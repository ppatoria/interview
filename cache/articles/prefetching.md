### Cache Optimization through Prefetching: Enhancing Non-Contiguous Data Processing

In the realm of high-performance computing, cache optimization is crucial for ensuring efficient data processing. My previous article focused on optimizing cache usage through data alignment, where we rearranged data structures and leveraged container alignment to maximize cache utilization. This technique works well for data stored in contiguous memory. However, in real-world scenarios, data might not always be stored in contiguous blocks. This article focuses on how to handle or optimize such data for cache using prefetching techniques.

### Example: Order Processing with Linked List

#### Initial Structure and Processing
Consider the following `Order` structure:
```cpp
struct Order {
    int orderID;
    double price;
    int quantity;
};
```
Processing orders in a linked list without prefetching:
```cpp
void processOrdersWithoutPrefetching(std::list<Order>& orders) {
    for (const auto& order : orders) {
        processOrder(order);
    }
}
```
This straightforward approach may suffer from cache misses due to non-contiguous memory access.

### Introducing Prefetching
Prefetching instructs the CPU to load data into the cache before it is accessed, reducing memory access latency. Modern CPUs support prefetching with non-blocking instructions, allowing subsequent instructions to execute while prefetching occurs in parallel. This non-blocking nature ensures that the CPU can continue executing other instructions while the data is being fetched into the cache.

Enhancing the above code with prefetching:
```cpp
void processOrdersWithPrefetching(std::list<Order>& orders) {
    auto it = orders.begin();
    // Prefetch the first element
    if (it != orders.end()) {
        _mm_prefetch(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(&(*it)), _MM_HINT_T0);
    }

    for (; it != orders.end(); ++it) {
        auto nextIt = std::next(it);
        if (nextIt != orders.end()) {
            _mm_prefetch(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(&(*nextIt)), _MM_HINT_T0);
        }
        processOrder(*it);
    }
}
```

### Understanding Prefetching

#### How Prefetching Works
1. **Non-Blocking Call**:
   - When we use `_mm_prefetch`, it asks the CPU to fetch data into the cache.
   - This fetching happens without stopping the CPU from doing other tasks. The CPU can keep working on other instructions while the data is being fetched.

2. **Prefetching in Practice**:
   - We want to fetch (or "prefetch") the next piece of data before we actually need to use it.
   - This way, when we need the data, it is already in the cache, ready to be used quickly.

#### Step-by-Step Example
1. **First Prefetch**:
   - At the start, we prefetch the first order before we enter the loop.
   - This ensures the first piece of data is ready to use right away.

```cpp
auto it = orders.begin();
if (it != orders.end()) {
    _mm_prefetch(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(&(*it)), _MM_HINT_T0);
}
```

2. **Inside the Loop**:
   - Inside the loop, we keep prefetching the next order while processing the current one.
   - This keeps the next piece of data ready in advance.

```cpp
for (; it != orders.end(); ++it) {
    auto nextIt = std::next(it);
    if (nextIt != orders.end()) {
        _mm_prefetch(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(&(*nextIt)), _MM_HINT_T0);
    }
    processOrder(*it);
}
```

#### Simple Breakdown
1. **Prefetch the Next Order**: This step fetches the next order while we are working on the current one.
2. **Non-Blocking Nature**: The CPU can continue working without waiting for the fetch to complete.
3. **Avoiding Close Prefetch**: Prefetching too close (i.e., fetching the same data we are about to use immediately) is not helpful. We need to fetch ahead to give the CPU time to complete the fetch.

By following these steps, we make sure that when the CPU needs data, it is already in the cache, improving performance.

### Further Improvement with Data Reordering
Reordering the `Order` structure to align with cache line sizes can enhance efficiency:
```cpp
struct Order {
    long price; // Aligning price to take advantage of 8-byte boundary
    int orderID;
    int quantity;
};
```
This reordering ensures that the structure size is a multiple of 64 bytes, fitting four instances in a cache line, maximizing cache utilization.

### Prefetching in Batches
In this section, we aim to improve cache efficiency by prefetching batches of orders. Let's break it down step-by-step in simple language.

#### Why Size 4?
- **Cache Line Size**: A typical cache line is 64 bytes.
- **Order Size**: Each `Order` struct is 16 bytes (after reordering).
- **Fit 4 Orders**: Since \( 64 \, \text{bytes} \div 16 \, \text{bytes/order} = 4 \), we can fit 4 `Order` structs in one cache line.

### Step-by-Step Example

1. **Initialize Batch and Iterator**:
   - We start by initializing an iterator and a batch array to hold 4 orders.

```cpp
auto it = orders.begin();
Order orderBatch[4];
```

2. **Prefetch and Process in Batches**:
   - Inside the loop, we prefetch the next 4 orders and store them in the batch array.
   - This ensures that the next 4 orders are fetched into the cache before they are processed.

```cpp
while (it != orders.end()) {
    size_t batchSize = 0;

    // Prefetch the next 4 orders and collect them in a batch
    for (int i = 0; i < 4 && it != orders.end(); ++i, ++it) {
        _mm_prefetch(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(&(*it)), _MM_HINT_T0);
        orderBatch[batchSize++] = *it;
    }

    // Process the batch of prefetched orders
    processOrderBatch(orderBatch, batchSize);
}
```

3. **Prefetch 4 Orders**:
   - The loop runs 4 times (if there are 4 orders available).
   - Each iteration prefetches one order and adds it to the batch array.

4. **Process the Batch**:
   - After collecting 4 orders (or fewer, if fewer are left), we process them in the batch.
   - This ensures that the fetched orders are used efficiently.

#### Simple Breakdown
1. **Initialize**: Set up the iterator and the batch array.
2. **Loop of 4**: Run a loop up to 4 times to prefetch and collect orders.
3. **Prefetch and Collect**: Prefetch the next order and add it to the batch.
4. **Process Batch**: Process all orders in the batch at once.

By processing orders in batches, we make full use of the cache line, reducing memory access latency and boosting performance.

### Conclusion
Prefetching is a powerful technique for optimizing cache usage when dealing with non-contiguous data. By understanding the non-blocking nature of prefetch instructions, leveraging compiler support, and combining data alignment with batch processing, we can significantly enhance data processing efficiency. This article serves as a guide for implementing prefetching in real-world scenarios, complementing the previous discussion on data alignment.
