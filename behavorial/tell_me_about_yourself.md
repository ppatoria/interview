**Tell Me About Yourself**

I am an **Senior Software Developer** with over **20 years of experience** specializing in **low-latency trading, algorithmic trading development, and high-performance computing**. My expertise lies in designing and optimizing **electronic trading platforms**, leveraging **C++ and Python** to build scalable and efficient systems.

Most recently, I worked as a **Vice President - Algorithmic Trading Developer at BNP Paribas, USA**, where I worked on integrating **Python-based trading strategies into a C++ execution framework**, reducing trade latency and enhancing performance. Prior to that, I held roles at **Credit Suisse**, where I designed and optimized **market data adapters, rule engines, and order execution systems** to improve trading efficiency and execution speed.

My core experience includes **low-latency programming, metaprogramming, FIX protocol, TCP/IP, multicast networking, and distributed systems**. I am also proficient in **Boost, STL, POCO, and various messaging frameworks such as UM/LBM and TIBCO Rendezvous**. Additionally, I have hands-on experience bridging **quant-driven Python strategies with high-performance C++ execution frameworks**.

Currently, I am exploring opportunities in **algorithmic trading, high-frequency trading (HFT), and performance engineering**, leveraging my deep expertise in **market data processing, order execution, and low-latency infrastructure**. I am also expanding my knowledge in **Rust**, focusing on its potential for **high-performance, safe concurrency in trading applications**.

Beyond technical execution, I have a strong inclination towards **mentorship, architectural decision-making, and optimizing development workflows** to improve team efficiency and system performance.

I am excited about opportunities that allow me to **push the boundaries of performance optimization** and contribute to **next-generation trading systems**. If you’re looking for someone who can **enhance trading performance, reduce latency, and build robust execution frameworks**, let’s connect!
