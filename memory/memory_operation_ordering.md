### Overview of Memory Operation Ordering

1. **Memory Operation Types**:
   - **Read Operation**: The CPU checks the cache (starting with L1, then L2, and L3) for the required data.
   If the data is not found in the cache, it fetches it from the main memory and stores it in the cache for future access.
   - **Write Operation**: The CPU writes the data to the cache.
   If the system uses a write-back policy, the data is written to the main memory only when the cache line containing the data is evicted from the cache.

2. **Cache Hierarchy**:
   - **L1 Cache**: Closest to the CPU and the fastest.
   - **L2 Cache**: Larger but slightly slower than L1.
   - **L3 Cache**: Shared among multiple CPU cores, larger and slower than L2.

3. **Write-Back Policy**:
   - In a write-back policy, data is first written to the cache and marked as "dirty."
   - The main memory is updated only when the dirty cache line is evicted, reducing the frequency of memory writes and improving performance.

4. **Eviction Process**:
   - When the cache is full, a cache line is evicted based on a replacement policy (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used).
   - If the evicted cache line is dirty, its data is written back to the main memory to ensure consistency.

By following these principles, modern CPUs and memory systems can achieve efficient data handling and improve overall system performance.

Absolutely, here's a summary of our discussion on cache eviction logic between L1, L2, and L3 caches, and cache promotion:

### Cache Eviction Logic

1. **L1 Cache**:
   - **Eviction Trigger**: Eviction occurs when the L1 cache is full, and new data needs to be loaded.
   - **Replacement Policy**: A replacement policy, such as Least Recently Used (LRU), determines which existing cache line to evict to make space for new data.
   - **Write-Back**: If the evicted cache line is "dirty" (i.e., it contains modified data), the data is written back to the main memory.

2. **L2 Cache**:
   - **Eviction Trigger**: Similar to L1, eviction in L2 occurs when the L2 cache is full, and new data needs to be loaded.
   - **Replacement Policy**: L2 uses its own replacement policy to decide which cache line to evict.
   - **Write-Back**: Dirty cache lines in L2 are written back to the main memory upon eviction.

3. **L3 Cache**:
   - **Eviction Trigger**: Eviction in L3 happens when the L3 cache is full, and new data needs to be loaded.
   - **Replacement Policy**: L3 uses a replacement policy to manage evictions.
   - **Write-Back**: As with L1 and L2, dirty cache lines in L3 are written back to the main memory upon eviction.

### Cache Promotion

1. **Cache Miss**:
   - **L1 Cache Miss**: If the CPU looks for data in the L1 cache and doesn't find it (cache miss), it checks the L2 cache.
   - **L2 Cache Miss**: If the data is not found in the L2 cache, the CPU then checks the L3 cache.
   - **L3 Cache Miss**: If the data is not found in the L3 cache, the CPU fetches it from the main memory.

2. **Data Found in L2 or L3**:
   - **Promotion to L1**: If the data is found in the L2 or L3 cache and there is space available in the L1 cache, the data will be loaded from L2 or L3 into L1. This ensures that frequently accessed data is moved to the fastest cache level, minimizing access time and improving performance.

### Key Points
- **Level-Specific Eviction**: Each cache level (L1, L2, L3) handles its own eviction process independently.
- **Eviction Trigger**: Eviction is triggered when the specific cache level being accessed is full and new data needs to be loaded.
- **Cache Promotion**: When a cache miss occurs in L1 but data is found in L2 or L3, and if there is space in L1, the data is promoted to L1 for faster future access.

This completes our discussion on the ordering of memory operations, focusing on cache eviction logic and cache promotion.
