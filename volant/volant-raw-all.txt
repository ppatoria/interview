1. Bike ride hydration
A cyclist rides a bike on a long, straight bicycle path. He has one water bottle- initially full. With a full bottle, he can ride at most "range" kilometres before passing out from dehydration. Please implement the C++20 function...
int min_refills(int start_pos, int finish_pos, int range, const
std::vector<int>& tap_positions)
...such that it efficiently (in a big-O sense) calculates and returns the minimum number of times he'd need to refill his water bottle when riding from the "start" kilometre mark to the "finish" kilometre mark. The kilometre positions of each tap where he can refill his bottle are provided in the "taps" argument. If it's not possible to reach the intended finish mark, min_refills should return -1.
For example, a call to...
min_refills(10, 20, 4, {13, 17, 18, 22,
7
30})
8

10
11
...models a desire to ride from the 10km mark and reach the 20km mark, an ability to ride 4 kms between refis, and taps at each of the 13, 17, 18, 22, and 30 kilometre marks. Starting at the 10km mark, after refilling twice - at the 13km and 17km marks - he'll have enough water to reach his finish point at the 20km mark, so min_refills should return
2.
Another examples:
min_refills(10, 25,
5, {13, 17, 18, 21, 22, 30}) should refill at 13, 17 or 18, 21 or 22kms => result 3.
NOTES
- all kilometre marks - start_pos, finish_pos and tap_positions (if any) - are in the range [0..1,000,000] inclusive - start <= finish, and tap_positions are distinct values in increasing order - range is in the range [1..1,000,000] km . Please implement  the below min_refills function  in c++20 and it should be as efficient at it could be.                                                                                    
 #include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
int min_refills(int start_pos, int finish_pos, int range, const vector<int>& tap_positions) {
    // please implement this function...

}
int main()
{
    int start_pos, finish_pos, range;
    std::vector<int> tap_positions;

    assert(cin >> start_pos >> finish_pos >> range);
    int temp;
    while (cin >> temp) tap_positions.push_back(temp);
    assert(cin.eof());

    int result = min_refills(start_pos, finish_pos, range, tap_positions);

    if (std::ofstream fout{getenv("OUTPUT_PATH")})
        fout << result << "\n";
    else
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
}

Sure, I can help you implement the min_refills function. The idea is to keep track of the last refill position and continuously look ahead in the tap_positions to the farthest tap that can be reached. If a tap cannot be reached, return -1. Here‚Äôs the C++20 code:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int min_refills(int start_pos, int finish_pos, int range, const vector<int>& tap_positions) {
    int n = tap_positions.size();
    int num_refills = 0, current_refill = 0;
    int current_pos = start_pos;

    while (current_pos + range < finish_pos) {
        if (current_refill >= n || tap_positions[current_refill] > current_pos + range) {
            // Cannot reach the next refill station
            return -1;
        }

        // Go to the furthest refill station within range
        while (current_refill < n-1 && tap_positions[current_refill+1] <= current_pos + range) {
            current_refill++;
        }

        current_pos = tap_positions[current_refill];
        num_refills++;
        current_refill++;
    }

    return num_refills;
}

int main() {
    int start_pos, finish_pos, range;
    std::vector<int> tap_positions;

    assert(cin >> start_pos >> finish_pos >> range);
    int temp;
    while (cin >> temp) tap_positions.push_back(temp);
    assert(cin.eof());

    int result = min_refills(start_pos, finish_pos, range, tap_positions);

    if (std::ofstream fout{getenv("OUTPUT_PATH")})
        fout << result << "\n";
    else
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
}

This function iterates through the tap_positions vector only once, so it runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of tap positions. This is as efficient as it could be for this problem. Please let me know if you have any questions about this code! üòä

2. TheGauge - virtual over generic
Which of the following are common reasons to prefer virtual dispatch over templates:
Pick ONE OR MORE options
wanting to share the implementation code in header files with users of the interface
wanting to hide the implementation code for faster compilation times
better code optimisation opportunities for the compiler
better compilation error messages (pre C++20)
ability to selectively include functions in the API based on the types involved

Here are the common reasons to prefer virtual dispatch over templates:

Wanting to hide the implementation code for faster compilation times: Templates require the implementation to be available at compile time, which can lead to longer compilation times and larger binary sizes. Virtual dispatch allows you to hide the implementation details in a source file, potentially leading to faster compilation times.
Better compilation error messages (pre C++20): Templates can sometimes produce complex and difficult-to-understand error messages, especially when template metaprogramming is involved. Virtual dispatch can often lead to clearer error messages.
Please note that each of these techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your project. üòä

You
why not "wanting to share the implementation code in header files with users of the interface" ?
Copilot
The statement ‚Äúwanting to share the implementation code in header files with users of the interface‚Äù is more related to templates than virtual dispatch.

In C++, templates are typically implemented in header files because they need to be available at compile time. This allows users of the template to see its implementation, which can be useful for understanding how the template works and can be customized.

On the other hand, virtual dispatch is a runtime mechanism. The implementation of virtual functions is typically provided in source files, not header files. This helps to hide the implementation details from the users of the interface, which can be beneficial for encapsulation and reducing compilation times.

So, if you want to share the implementation code in header files with users of the interface, templates would be a more suitable choice than virtual dispatch. üòä

You
"ability to selectively include functions in the API based on the types involved " why not this ?
Copilot
The statement ‚Äúability to selectively include functions in the API based on the types involved‚Äù is more related to templates than virtual dispatch.

Templates in C++ allow for compile-time polymorphism. This means you can have different implementations of a function for different types, and the appropriate implementation is chosen at compile time based on the type of the arguments. This is known as function template specialization. It allows you to selectively include functions in the API based on the types involved.

On the other hand, virtual dispatch is a form of runtime polymorphism and doesn‚Äôt provide this ability. With virtual dispatch, you define a set of functions in a base class and these can be overridden in derived classes. However, the functions that are part of the interface are fixed at compile time and can‚Äôt be selectively included based on the types involved at runtime.

So, if you want the ability to selectively include functions in the API based on the types involved, templates would be a more suitable choice than virtual dispatch. üòä

3. TheGauge - rules of thumb, points of departure
As rules of thumb and points of departure:
Pick ONE OR MORE options
move constructors and move operators should be noexcept
base classes with virtual functions should not be copyable
constructors should either succeed, wait for a later init() call, or put their object in a well-defined error state
prefer making operators like == and < non-member functions
to help support deep-copying of a runtime polymorphic object, provide a "virtual size_t size() const" function
memset() your large objects to 0 bytes to avoid uninitialised memory reads
when comparing doubles, consider any two values within std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon of each other to be equal
Clear Selection
Copilot
Here are the options that are generally considered good practices in C++:

Move constructors and move operators should be noexcept: This is generally a good practice because it allows certain optimizations by the compiler and the standard library, and it provides a strong exception safety guarantee.
Base classes with virtual functions should not be copyable: This is a good rule of thumb to prevent slicing, where an object of a derived class is copied into an object of the base class, losing the derived class data.
Constructors should either succeed, wait for a later init() call, or put their object in a well-defined error state: This is a good practice because it ensures that objects are always in a valid state after construction.
Prefer making operators like == and < non-member functions: This can improve code clarity and enable more flexible type conversions.
When comparing doubles, consider any two values within std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon of each other to be equal: Due to the nature of floating-point representation, it‚Äôs often a good idea to consider two floating-point numbers equal if they are close enough, rather than expecting them to be exactly equal.
The other options are not generally considered good practices:

To help support deep-copying of a runtime polymorphic object, provide a ‚Äúvirtual size_t size() const‚Äù function: This is not a common or recommended practice for supporting deep copying of polymorphic objects. Instead, a common practice is to provide a virtual clone() function.
memset() your large objects to 0 bytes to avoid uninitialized memory reads: In C++, using memset() on non-trivial objects can lead to undefined behavior. It‚Äôs better to initialize your objects properly using constructors. üòä

which of the following are plausible reasonable things todo with iostreams?                                                       Pick ONE OR MORE options

struct X { int i; double d; }; inline std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const X& x) { return os << x.i << ", " << x.d; }

struct X { int i; double d; };inline std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, X& x) { char c; if (is >> x.i >> c >> x.d && c != ',') is.setstate(std::ios::failbit); return is;}

if (std::ifstream in{filename}) while (!in.eof()) { getline(in, my_string); process(my_string); }

#define STR(X) static_cast<std::ostringstream&&>(std::ostringstream{} <<X).str() // for this, ignore the general evil-ness of macros
Copilot
Here are the plausible and reasonable things to do with iostreams from your options:

Defining output operator for a struct: This is a common practice in C++. It allows you to print the contents of the struct in a formatted way. So, this is plausible:
struct X { int i; double d; };
inline std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const X& x) { return os << x.i << ", " << x.d; }

Defining input operator for a struct: This is also a common practice. It allows you to read the contents of the struct from an input stream. So, this is plausible:
struct X { int i; double d; };
inline std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, X& x) { char c; if (is >> x.i >> c >> x.d && c != ',') is.setstate(std::ios::failbit); return is;}

Reading a file line by line: This is a common way to read a file line by line in C++. However, using while (!in.eof()) is not recommended because it can result in the last line being processed twice if it doesn‚Äôt end with a newline. A better way is while (getline(in, my_string)). So, this is plausible with a slight modification:
if (std::ifstream in{filename}) while (getline(in, my_string)) { process(my_string); }

Defining a macro to convert something to a string: While this is plausible and can work, it‚Äôs generally not recommended to use macros in C++ when alternatives exist. In this case, you could use a template function or a std::ostringstream directly. So, this is plausible but not recommended:
#define STR(X) static_cast<std::ostringstream&&>(std::ostringstream{} <<X).str()

which of the following are true statements about preprocessor macros i.e. #defines                                               Pick ONE OR MORE options

preprocessor defines are implicitly undefined at the end of the scope (e.g. namespace, class, function) in which they're defined

X(ok, --) might be a valid macro call, even when ok is not an identifier anywhere in your program, and -- is not applied to any value

if you #include a file, then redefine a macro used in the file and #include the file again, your translation unit can end up with code based on the two distinct substitutions

just like an inline function, __LINE__ and __FILE__ can be used inside a preprocessor macro to access the line and file wherein the macro is defined

macros are the only C++ mechanism for composing source code identifiers from parts
Copilot
Here are the true statements about preprocessor macros i.e. #defines from your options:

X(ok, --) might be a valid macro call, even when ok is not an identifier anywhere in your program, and ‚Äì is not applied to any value: This is true. The arguments to a macro are not evaluated before the macro is expanded. So, ok and -- are just treated as tokens and substituted into the macro body wherever the corresponding parameter names appear.
If you #include a file, then redefine a macro used in the file and #include the file again, your translation unit can end up with code based on the two distinct substitutions: This is true. The preprocessor does text substitution before the compiler sees the code. If a macro is redefined, the new definition will be used for subsequent substitutions in the translation unit.
Just like an inline function, LINE and FILE can be used inside a preprocessor macro to access the line and file wherein the macro is defined: This is true. The __LINE__ and __FILE__ macros are replaced with the current line number and file name, respectively, where they appear.
Macros are the only C++ mechanism for composing source code identifiers from parts: This is true. The preprocessor‚Äôs token-pasting operator (##) allows you to combine tokens to form new identifiers, a capability that doesn‚Äôt exist elsewhere in C++.
The statement ‚Äúpreprocessor defines are implicitly undefined at the end of the scope (e.g. namespace, class, function) in which they‚Äôre defined‚Äù is not true. Preprocessor definitions are not aware of C++ scopes. They remain defined until they are #undef‚Äôed or until the end of the translation unit. üòä

iterators to elements in an unordered_map may be invalidated by insertions

constexpr always ensures something is evaluated at compile time

the C++ Standard requires compilers to ensure lambdas never capture dangling references

given a std::string containing the source code for a function call and arguments, C++ Standard Library functions let you evaluate the function call and save the results in another string

a container providing iterators is functionally more flexible than one providing "void visit(auto functor_to_call_for_each_node)" instead

move semantics only help if a class has data-owning pointer data members

the member function "template <typename T> void Class::function(T&& t) { f(t); member_save_t_ = std::move(t); }" uses std::move() properly

sigaction-installed async signal handlers shouldn't write any output - directly or indirectly - using printf, std::cout or std::cerr
Copilot
Here are the true statements from your options:

Iterators to elements in an unordered_map may be invalidated by insertions: This is true. According to the C++ Standard, insertions into an unordered_map can invalidate iterators if rehashing occurs.
The C++ Standard requires compilers to ensure lambdas never capture dangling references: This is not directly stated in the C++ Standard. However, it‚Äôs the programmer‚Äôs responsibility to ensure that lambdas do not capture dangling references, as this would lead to undefined behavior.
A container providing iterators is functionally more flexible than one providing ‚Äúvoid visit(auto functor_to_call_for_each_node)‚Äù instead: This is generally true. Iterators provide more flexibility as they allow the user of the container to control the traversal, whereas a visit function encapsulates the traversal within the container.
Sigaction-installed async signal handlers shouldn‚Äôt write any output - directly or indirectly - using printf, std::cout or std::cerr: This is true. The functions printf, std::cout, and std::cerr are not async-signal-safe. Using them in a signal handler can result in undefined behavior.
The other statements are not generally true:

The const keyword allows you to guarantee all class invariants: The const keyword can help maintain some invariants, but it doesn‚Äôt guarantee all class invariants. Class invariants depend on the logic of your code.
Constexpr always ensures something is evaluated at compile time: This is not always true. A constexpr function or variable may be evaluated at compile time, but it can also be evaluated at runtime if its value is not known at compile time.
Given a std::string containing the source code for a function call and arguments, C++ Standard Library functions let you evaluate the function call and save the results in another string: This is not possible with the C++ Standard Library. C++ does not support this kind of reflection or interpretation.
Move semantics only help if a class has data-owning pointer data members: This is not true. Move semantics can also be beneficial for classes that manage other kinds of resources, or classes with members that themselves benefit from move semantics.
The member function ‚Äútemplate <typename T> void Class::function(T&& t) { f(t); member_save_t_ = std::move(t); }‚Äù uses std::move() properly: This is not necessarily true. After f(t), t may be in a moved-from state, and moving from it again into member_save_t_ may not be safe or meaningful. It depends on the specifics of the type T and the function f.

when hashing data that hasn't been deliberately engineered to create collisions, using a crptographic strength hash function - instead of your standard library's- could never-the-less be useful to reduce the risk of excessive collisions when :                                                                                          Pick ONE OR MORE options

the hash table load factor will be very low

the keys tend to be incrementing integers, but there may be small gaps every now and then

the keys are randomly generated

you don't know anything about the keys

the keys are properly aligned double*s, your std::hash implementation uses an identity hash and std::unordered_* containers use prime-number bucket counts
Copilot
Here are the scenarios where using a cryptographic strength hash function could be useful to reduce the risk of excessive collisions:

The keys are randomly generated: Cryptographic hash functions are designed to distribute keys uniformly across the hash space, even for randomly generated keys. This can help reduce collisions.
You don‚Äôt know anything about the keys: If you don‚Äôt know anything about the distribution of your keys, a cryptographic hash function can help ensure a uniform distribution of keys in the hash space, reducing the likelihood of collisions.
The keys are properly aligned doubles, your std::hash implementation uses an identity hash and std::unordered_ containers use prime-number bucket counts: In this case, if the keys are close together, they may end up in the same bucket with an identity hash function. A cryptographic hash function can help distribute these keys more evenly across the buckets.
The other options are not generally reasons to use a cryptographic hash function:

The hash table load factor will be very low: The load factor of a hash table is the number of elements divided by the number of buckets. A low load factor means that there are many more buckets than elements, so the risk of collision is already low.
The keys tend to be incrementing integers, but there may be small gaps every now and then: If the keys are incrementing integers, even with small gaps, they are likely to be distributed fairly evenly across the hash space with a simple hash function. A cryptographic hash function is unlikely to provide significant benefits in this case. üòä

char* p = (char*)malloc(6); realloc(p, 10); strncpy(p, "hello", sizeof "hello");
Copilot
Here are the code snippets that have or risk unspecified or undefined behavior:

void f(int& n) { reinterpret_cast<unsigned>(&n) /= 2; }: This code is risky because it uses reinterpret_cast to cast an int pointer to an unsigned pointer. This can lead to undefined behavior if the sizes of int and unsigned are not the same.
double d; d = 2.13; std::cout << reinterpret_cast<uint64_t>(&d);: This code is risky because it uses reinterpret_cast to cast a double pointer to a uint64_t pointer. This can lead to undefined behavior because the binary representations of double and uint64_t are different.
const char p = ‚Äúlex‚Äù; auto h = hash32(p[0], p[1], p[2], p[3]); // hash32 safe with any 4 char values*: This code risks undefined behavior because it accesses p[3], which is beyond the end of the string ‚Äúlex‚Äù. The comment suggests that hash32 is safe with any 4 char values, but ‚Äúlex‚Äù only provides 3 characters.
char p = (char)malloc(6); realloc(p, 10); strncpy(p, ‚Äúhello‚Äù, sizeof ‚Äúhello‚Äù);**: This code has undefined behavior because it doesn‚Äôt update p after reallocating memory. After realloc(p, 10), p may be a dangling pointer if realloc moved the memory block. The subsequent strncpy(p, "hello", sizeof "hello"); then risks undefined behavior.
The code snippet auto f(int n) { auto result = 3983 / (n + 1); return -result; } does not have or risk unspecified or undefined behavior, assuming that n is not equal to -1. üòä

9. TheGauge - untrusted TCP client
Your TCP server accepted a connection from an untrusted TCP client, and is now - per the protocol it uses - expecting a 3000-byte message. On the accepted client socket, which is in blocking mode, it reads into a memory-page sized buffer using read (client_fd, my_4096_byte_buffer, sizeof my 4096_byte_buffer). Select all the true statements below:
Pick ONE OR MORE options
The read call returning 1..2999 bytes would indicate that the client deliberately sent an incomplete message.
The read call will either return a value indicating disconnection, or wait until it has read a complete 3000-byte message, so the client can't engineer a situation where read returns a value in the 1..2999 range.
You could have to call read up to 3000 times to receive the entire message required by the protocol.
The read call could return a value between 3001 and 4096, in which case the first 3000 bytes should be parsed as the expected message, and the remainder should be considered part or all of subsequent message(s).
If the read call returns 4096, the client must be trying to flood the server with data as part of a denial of service attack.
Clear Selection
Copilot
Here are the true statements from your options:

You could have to call read up to 3000 times to receive the entire message required by the protocol: This is true. The read function may not return all the requested data in one call, especially if the data is arriving over a network. You may need to call read multiple times to get all the data.
The other statements are not generally true:

The read call returning 1‚Ä¶2999 bytes would indicate that the client deliberately sent an incomplete message: This is not necessarily true. The read function may return fewer bytes than requested for various reasons, such as if the data is still being transmitted over the network.
The read call will either return a value indicating disconnection, or wait until it has read a complete 3000-byte message, so the client can‚Äôt engineer a situation where read returns a value in the 1‚Ä¶2999 range: This is not true. The read function can return any number of bytes up to the number requested, depending on how much data is available.
The read call could return a value between 3001 and 4096, in which case the first 3000 bytes should be parsed as the expected message, and the remainder should be considered part or all of subsequent message(s): This is not true. The read function will not return more bytes than requested. If you request 3000 bytes, it will not return 3001 or more bytes.
If the read call returns 4096, the client must be trying to flood the server with data as part of a denial of service attack: This is not necessarily true. The read function returning a large number of bytes simply means that a lot of data was available to be read. It does not necessarily indicate a denial of service attack. üòä

Complete the blanks in the following question with the appropriate answer.
Given operations on N-element containers, type one of "1", "5", "logN", "N", "NlogN", "NN", or "bucket_count()" for the (average, amortised if applicable) big-O efficiencies of:
- constructing a linked list from the contents of a vector is O( -finding elements above a specific value in a std::set is O(__ - inserting 5 elements into a std::unordered_set is O(

-finding the number of squares a knight could potentially reach in its next two moves on a N*N chess board (each knight move is 2
squares left, right, up, or down, then 1 square perpendicular to that initial movement) is O(_
Copilot
Here are the answers to your questions:

Constructing a linked list from the contents of a vector is O( N ): You have to iterate through all elements in the vector to create the linked list.
Finding elements above a specific value in a std::set is O( logN ): A std::set is typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree. Finding an element in such a tree is a logarithmic operation.
Inserting 5 elements into a std::unordered_set is O( 1 ): Insertion into a hash table (which is what std::unordered_set is) is a constant time operation on average. However, please note that in the worst case (when a rehash happens), it could be O(N).
vector::push_back to a vector already at capacity is O( N ): When a vector is at capacity and an element is pushed back, the vector typically has to allocate a new block of memory, copy the existing elements to the new block, and then deallocate the old block.
std::unordered_map::begin() + 1 in a container where most elements have already been erased is O( 1 ): Incrementing an iterator is a constant time operation.
Finding the number of squares a knight could potentially reach in its next two moves on a N*N chess board (each knight move is 2 squares left, right, up, or down, then 1 square perpendicular to that initial movement) is O( 1 ): The number of squares a knight can reach in two moves does not depend on the size of the board (as long as it‚Äôs at least 5x5), so this is a constant time operation. üòä

11. Average Prices
SCENARIO
The four space-separated message formats below describe the placement, modifying, and trading (i.e. "fill"ing) of orders at a securities exchange throughout the day:
new <order-id> <security> <buy sell> <quantity> <price> modify <order-id-from-new> <order-id> <quantity> <price> modify <order-id-from-earlier- modify> <order-id> <quantity> <price>
fill <order-id> <quantity> <price>
Terminology:
‚Ä¢ A chain (of orders) refers to a "new" order message, followed by 0 or more "modify"s, each referencing the previous message in the chain by order id. (Example below.)
‚Ä¢ The volume-weighted average price ("vwap") of one or more fill
messages is the total money exchanged divided by the total number of shares exchanged. For example, fills for 5 shares at 100.00, 10 shares at 130.00, and 5 shares at 150.00, would have vwap of (5*100.00 + 10*130.00 + 5*150.00) / (5 +10+5)=(500.00 + 1300.00 + 750.00) / 20 = 2550.00/20 = 127.50.
Due to race conditions at the exchange, a "fill" message's order-id can be from any "new" or "modify" message previously seen in the input messages.

containers) and clean implementation for the function...

‚Ä¢ <order-id>s are those seen in "new"
messages, and appear in the returned vector<string> in the same order as in the "new" messages in the input
<total-fill-quantity> is the sum of the <quantity>s in "fill" messages for that chain of orders (or 0 if there are no fills)
‚Ä¢ <vwap> is the volume weighted average price (see example below) for the "fill"s on that chain of orders rounded down (or 0.00 if there are no fills).

If you glance over the following messages (you don't need to consider
all the naunces)...
new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00 order-id 1: someone wants to buy 20 shares of IBM for <= $1250.00

they decided 15 shares is enough, and only want to pay <= $1240.00 new 3 IBM buy 40 1245.00
//

fill 2 5 1240.00
// the
original trader bought 5 shares for $1240.00 each
fill 3 40 1243.00
order 3 above got all 40 shares for
$1243.00 each
modify 4 5 15 1240.00
// the
original trader wants to put the price
back down now there's no
competition to buy
fill 4 5 1250.00
// but
before that took effect they'd already
bought 5 at the higher price of
$1250.00
modify 5 6 20 1240.00
...there is a chain that includes order- ids 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. order-id 3 is in a distinct chain by itself, as is order-id 101.
The three fills are all for orders in the chain started by the "new" message with order-id 1, so that chain's vwap should be (5* 1240.00 + 40 * 1243.00 +5*1250.00) / (5 +40 +5)= 1243.40. The other chains don't have
any fills.
The returned vector should contain

This is not satisfying the requirement; some unit tests are failing . Please go through the following again and provide the solution.The four space-separated message formats below describe the placement, modifying, and trading (i.e. "fill"ing) of orders at a securities exchange throughout the day:
new <order-id> <security> <buy sell> <quantity> <price> modify <order-id-from-new> <order-id> <quantity> <price> modify <order-id-from-earlier- modify> <order-id> <quantity> <price>
fill <order-id> <quantity> <price>
Terminology:
‚Ä¢ A chain (of orders) refers to a "new" order message, followed by 0 or more "modify"s, each referencing the previous message in the chain by order id. (Example below.)
‚Ä¢ The volume-weighted average price ("vwap") of one or more fill
messages is the total money exchanged divided by the total number of shares exchanged. For example, fills for 5 shares at 100.00, 10 shares at 130.00, and 5 shares at 150.00, would have vwap of (5*100.00 + 10*130.00 + 5*150.00) / (5 +10+5)=(500.00 + 1300.00 + 750.00) / 20 = 2550.00/20 = 127.50.
Due to race conditions at the exchange, a "fill" message's order-id can be from any "new" or "modify" message previously seen in the input messages.
TASK
Provide efficient (in terms of big-O efficiency of operations on
containers) and clean implementation for the function...
vector<string> average_prices (const vector<string>& messages);
... which is passed a sequence of exchange messages - as described above - and must return a vector containing strings with the format...
<order-id> <total-fill-quanity> <vwap>
...where:Ôªø
‚Ä¢ <order-id>s are those seen in "new"
messages, and appear in the returned vector<string> in the same order as in the "new" messages in the input
<total-fill-quantity> is the sum of the <quantity>s in "fill" messages for that chain of orders (or 0 if there are no fills)
‚Ä¢ <vwap> is the volume weighted average price (see example below) for the "fill"s on that chain of orders rounded down (or 0.00 if there are no fills).

I understand the requirements better now. Here‚Äôs an updated implementation of the average_prices function:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Order {
    long long total_quantity = 0;
    long long total_value = 0;
    int original_id;
};

vector<string> average_prices(const vector<string>& messages) {
    unordered_map<int, Order> orders;

        if (type == "new") {
            int order_id;

            order_ids.push_back(order_id);
            id_mapping[order_id] = order_id;
            orders[order_id].original_id = order_id;
        } else if (type == "modify") {
            int old_order_id, new_order_id;
            ss >> old_order_id >> new_order_id;
            id_mapping[new_order_id] = id_mapping[old_order_id];
        } else if (type == "fill") {
            int order_id;
            long long quantity;
            double price;
            ss >> order_id >> quantity >> price;
            orders[id_mapping[order_id]].total_quantity += quantity;
            orders[id_mapping[order_id]].total_value += quantity * price;
        }
    }
    vector<string> result;
    for (const auto& order_id : order_ids) {
        stringstream ss;
        ss << order_id << " " << orders[order_id].total_quantity << " ";
        if (orders[order_id].total_quantity == 0) {
            ss << "0.00";
        } else {
            ss << fixed << setprecision(2) << floor((double)orders[order_id].total_value / orders[order_id].total_quantity * 100) / 100;
        }
        result.push_back(ss.str());
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    ofstream fout(getenv("OUTPUT_PATH"));
    vector<string> messages;
    string line;
    while (std::getline(std::cin, line))

    vector<string> result = average_prices(messages);
    for (const auto& chain_vwap: result)
        fout << chain_vwap << '\n';
}

This function maintains a map of orders, where each order keeps track of the total quantity and total value of its fills. It also keeps track of the order of the new orders and a mapping of order ids to their original ids. After processing all the messages, it calculates the volume-weighted average price for each order and returns the results in the order of the new orders.

You
can you please list all the test cases (in simple english) for this code discussed in the description ?
Copilot
Sure, here are some test cases that could be used to validate the average_prices function:

Single New Order Without Fills: Test a scenario where there is a single ‚Äúnew‚Äù order message without any ‚Äúfill‚Äù messages. The expected output should show the order id with a total fill quantity and VWAP of 0.
Single New Order With Single Fill: Test a scenario where there is a single ‚Äúnew‚Äù order message followed by a single ‚Äúfill‚Äù message for that order. The expected output should show the order id with the fill quantity and price from the ‚Äúfill‚Äù message.
Single New Order With Multiple Fills: Test a scenario where there is a single ‚Äúnew‚Äù order message followed by multiple ‚Äúfill‚Äù messages for that order. The expected output should show the order id with the total fill quantity and the VWAP calculated from the ‚Äúfill‚Äù messages.
Multiple New Orders Without Fills: Test a scenario where there are multiple ‚Äúnew‚Äù order messages without any ‚Äúfill‚Äù messages. The expected output should show each order id with a total fill quantity and VWAP of 0, in the same order as the ‚Äúnew‚Äù messages.
Multiple New Orders With Fills: Test a scenario where there are multiple ‚Äúnew‚Äù order messages, each followed by one or more ‚Äúfill‚Äù messages for that order. The expected output should show each order id with its total fill quantity and VWAP, in the same order as the ‚Äúnew‚Äù messages.
New Order With Modifications and Fills: Test a scenario where there is a ‚Äúnew‚Äù order message, followed by one or more ‚Äúmodify‚Äù messages, and then one or more ‚Äúfill‚Äù messages. The expected output should show the original order id with the total fill quantity and VWAP from the ‚Äúfill‚Äù messages.
Invalid Messages: Test a scenario where there are invalid messages, such as ‚Äúfill‚Äù messages for an order id that doesn‚Äôt exist. The function should handle these gracefully.
Large Input: Test a scenario with a large number of messages to ensure the function can handle it efficiently.
Remember, these are just some basic test cases. Depending on the exact requirements and constraints of your application, you might need to add more complex test cases. üòä

You can copy and paste this code into your compiler, replacing the comment // ... (average_prices function goes here) ... with the average_prices function. The run_test function takes a vector of messages and a vector of expected results, runs the average_prices function on the messages, and checks that the result matches the expected result. If all tests pass, it prints ‚ÄúAll tests passed!‚Äù üòä

seems some corner cases are not covered in unit test. please analyze the following and cover all the corner cases and all the scenarious. 11. Average Prices
SCENARIO
The four space-separated message formats below describe the placement, modifying, and trading (i.e. "fill"ing) of orders at a securities exchange throughout the day:
new <order-id> <security> <buy sell> <quantity> <price> modify <order-id-from-new> <order-id> <quantity> <price> modify <order-id-from-earlier- modify> <order-id> <quantity> <price>
fill <order-id> <quantity> <price>
Terminology:
‚Ä¢ A chain (of orders) refers to a "new" order message, followed by 0 or more "modify"s, each referencing the previous message in the chain by order id. (Example below.)
‚Ä¢ The volume-weighted average price ("vwap") of one or more fill
messages is the total money exchanged divided by the total number of shares exchanged. For example, fills for 5 shares at 100.00, 10 shares at 130.00, and 5 shares at 150.00, would have vwap of (5*100.00 + 10*130.00 + 5*150.00) / (5 +10+5)=(500.00 + 1300.00 + 750.00) / 20 = 2550.00/20 = 127.50.
Due to race conditions at the exchange, a "fill" message's order-id can be from any "new" or "modify" message previously seen in the input messages.
TASK
Provide efficient (in terms of big-O efficiency of operations on
containers) and clean implementation for the function...
vector<string> average_prices (const vector<string>& messages);
... which is passed a sequence of exchange messages - as described above - and must return a vector containing strings with the format...
<order-id> <total-fill-quanity> <vwap>
...where:Ôªø
‚Ä¢ <order-id>s are those seen in "new"
messages, and appear in the returned vector<string> in the same order as in the "new" messages in the input
<total-fill-quantity> is the sum of the <quantity>s in "fill" messages for that chain of orders (or 0 if there are no fills)
‚Ä¢ <vwap> is the volume weighted average price (see example below) for the "fill"s on that chain of orders rounded down (or 0.00 if there are no fills).
EXAMPLE
If you glance over the following messages (you don't need to consider
all the naunces)...
new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00 order-id 1: someone wants to buy 20 shares of IBM for <= $1250.00
modify 1 2 15 1240.00
they decided 15 shares is enough, and only want to pay <= $1240.00 new 3 IBM buy 40 1245.00
//
order-id 3: a distinct order to buy 40 shares of IBM for <= $1245.00
new 101 MSFT sell 40 100.00
modify 2 4 15 1250.00
fill 2 5 1240.00
// the
original trader bought 5 shares for $1240.00 each
fill 3 40 1243.00
order 3 above got all 40 shares for
$1243.00 each
modify 4 5 15 1240.00
// the
original trader wants to put the price
back down now there's no
competition to buy
fill 4 5 1250.00
// but
before that took effect they'd already
bought 5 at the higher price of
$1250.00
modify 5 6 20 1240.00
...there is a chain that includes order- ids 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. order-id 3 is in a distinct chain by itself, as is order-id 101.
The three fills are all for orders in the chain started by the "new" message with order-id 1, so that chain's vwap should be (5* 1240.00 + 40 * 1243.00 +5*1250.00) / (5 +40 +5)= 1243.40. The other chains don't have
any fills.
The returned vector should contain
the three strings (without double-
quotes), sorted as follows:
"1 50 1243.40"
"3 0 0.00" "101 0 0.00"
ÔªøNOTES
‚Ä¢ There will be 1 to 1,000,000 lines of input, for 1 to 1,000,000 distinct order ids, each of which is an integer between 0 and 1 billion (i.e. 1E9) inclusive.
‚Ä¢ All messages, fields and values will be valid / no validation is required or wanted.
‚Ä¢ Prices in dollars and cents, e.g. 1239.29.
‚ö´ No special effort need be made to avoid normal floating point errors, but do use double rather than floats
‚Ä¢ <quantity>s and <total-fill-quantity>s are integers between 1 and 1,000,000 (1E6) inclusive.
‚Ä¢ <price>s will be between 0.01 and 9999.99 inclusive.
‚Ä¢ Security names consist of 1 or more of the letters 'A' through 'Z'.

I understand the requirements better now. Let‚Äôs try to address the issues. The key point here is to correctly track the order chains and calculate the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) for each chain. Here‚Äôs an updated version of the function:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Order {
    long long total_quantity = 0;
    long long total_value = 0;
};

vector<string> average_prices(const vector<string>& messages) {
    unordered_map<int, Order> orders;
    unordered_map<int, int> id_mapping;
    vector<int> order_ids;
    for (const auto& message : messages) {
        stringstream ss(message);
        string type;
        ss >> type;
        if (type == "new") {
            int order_id;
            ss >> order_id;
            order_ids.push_back(order_id);
            id_mapping[order_id] = order_id;
        } else if (type == "modify") {
            int old_order_id, new_order_id;
            ss >> old_order_id >> new_order_id;
            id_mapping[new_order_id] = id_mapping[old_order_id];
        } else if (type == "fill") {
            int order_id;
            long long quantity;
            double price;
            ss >> order_id >> quantity >> price;
            int original_id = id_mapping[order_id];
            orders[original_id].total_quantity += quantity;
            orders[original_id].total_value += quantity * price;
        }
    }
    vector<string> result;
    for (const auto& order_id : order_ids) {
        stringstream ss;
        ss << order_id << " " << orders[order_id].total_quantity << " ";
        if (orders[order_id].total_quantity == 0) {
            ss << "0.00";
        } else {
            ss << fixed << setprecision(2) << floor((double)orders[order_id].total_value / orders[order_id].total_quantity * 100) / 100;
        }
        result.push_back(ss.str());
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    ofstream fout(getenv("OUTPUT_PATH"));
    vector<string> messages;
    string line;
    while (std::getline(std::cin, line))
        if (!line.empty()) messages.push_back(line);
    vector<string> result = average_prices(messages);
    for (const auto& chain_vwap: result)
        fout << chain_vwap << '\n';
}

This function maintains a map of orders, where each order keeps track of the total quantity and total value of its fills. It also keeps track of the order of the new orders and a mapping of order ids to their original ids. After processing all the messages, it calculates the volume-weighted average price for each order and returns the results in the order of the new orders. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of messages. üòä

Now, let‚Äôs add some additional test cases to cover all the corner cases and scenarios:

void run_test(const vector<string>& messages, const vector<string>& expected) {
    vector<string> result = average_prices(messages);
    assert(result == expected);
}

int main() {
    // Test 1: Single New Order Without Fills
    run_test({"new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00"}, {"1 0 0.00"});

    // Test 2: Single New Order With Single Fill
    run_test({"new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00", "fill 1 5 1240.00"}, {"1 5 1240.00"});

    // Test 3: Single New Order With Multiple Fills
    run_test({"new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00", "fill 1 5 1240.00", "fill 1 5 1250.00"}, {"1 10 1245.00"});

    // Test 4: Multiple New Orders Without Fills
    run_test({"new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00", "new 2 IBM buy 20 1250.00"}, {"1 0 0.00", "2 0 0.00"});

    // Test 5: Multiple New Orders With Fills
    run_test({"new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00", "fill 1 5 1240.00", "new 2 IBM buy 20 1250.00", "fill 2 5 1250.00"}, {"1 5 1240.00", "2 5 1250.00"});

    // Test 6: New Order With Modifications and Fills
    run_test({"new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00", "modify 1 2 15 1240.00", "fill 2 5 1240.00"}, {"1 5 1240.00"});

    // Test 7: Invalid Messages
    run_test({"new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00", "fill 2 5 1240.00"}, {"1 0 0.00"});

    // Test 8: New Order With Multiple Modifications and Fills
    run_test({"new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00", "modify 1 2 15 1240.00", "fill 2 5 1240.00", "modify 2 3 15 1250.00", "fill 3 5 1250.00"}, {"1 10 1245.00"});

    // Test 9: Multiple New Orders With Multiple Modifications and Fills
    run_test({"new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00", "modify 1 2 15 1240.00", "fill 2 5 1240.00", "new 3 IBM buy 40 1245.00", "fill 3 40 1243.00", "modify 2 4 15 1250.00", "fill 4 5 1250.00"}, {"1 10 1245.00", "3 40 1243.00"});

    cout << "All tests passed!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

These tests cover a variety of scenarios, including single and multiple new orders, orders with and without fills, orders with modifications, and invalid messages. They should provide a good coverage of the function‚Äôs behavior. üòä

Copilot
I apologize for the oversight. The provided example scenario is not explicitly covered in the unit tests. Let‚Äôs add a test case for this scenario:

// Test 9: Scenario from the example
run_test({
    "new 1 IBM buy 20 1250.00",
    "modify 1 2 15 1240.00",
    "new 3 IBM buy 40 1245.00",
    "new 101 MSFT sell 40 100.00",
    "modify 2 4 15 1250.00",
    "fill 2 5 1240.00",
    "fill 3 40 1243.00",
    "modify 4 5 15 1240.00",
    "fill 4 5 1250.00",
    "modify 5 6 20 1240.00"
}, {
    "1 10 1245.00",
    "3 40 1243.00",
    "101 0 0.00"
});

This test case covers a scenario where there are multiple ‚Äúnew‚Äù orders with multiple modifications and fills, which matches the scenario described in the example. The expected output is based on the VWAP calculation described in the example. üòä

You
have you considered; scenarious with incorrect data ?
Copilot
Yes, it‚Äôs important to consider scenarios with incorrect data when designing unit tests. However, the problem statement specifies that all messages, fields, and values will be valid, so no validation is required or wanted. Therefore, in this specific context, we are not required to handle incorrect data.

In a real-world scenario, it would be crucial to add tests for incorrect data to ensure the function behaves as expected. These could include tests for things like missing fields, incorrect data types, out of range values, and so on. üòä

Are you sure you have covered all the following .                                                                                                                                                                    Ôªø

...there is a chain that includes order-ids 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. order-id 3 is in a distinct chain by itself, as is order-id 101.
The three fills are all for orders in the chain started by the "new" message with order-id 1, so that chain's vwap should be (5* 1240.00 + 40 * 1243.00 +5*1250.00)/(5+40 +5)=1243.40. The other chains don't have any fills.
The returned vector should contain the three strings (without double-quotes), sorted as follows:

this test gets "output.s: /app/example.cpp:52: void run_test(const std::vector<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char> >&, const std::vector<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char> >&): Assertion `result == expected' failed.
Program terminated with signal: SIGSEGV"
Copilot
I apologize for the confusion. The error message indicates that the assertion in the run_test function failed, which means the output of the average_prices function did not match the expected output. This could be due to an issue in the average_prices function or in the test case itself.

The error message also mentions a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), which typically occurs when the program tries to read or write an incorrect location in memory. This could be caused by an out-of-bounds array index, a null pointer dereference, or other types of memory errors.

Without the actual implementation of the average_prices function, it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint the exact cause of the error. However, here are a few things you could check:

Memory Access: Make sure the program is not accessing memory it doesn‚Äôt own, such as going past the end of an array or dereferencing a null pointer.
Data Types: Ensure that all data types are correct. For example, make sure you‚Äôre not treating an integer as a pointer, or vice versa.
Logic Errors: Check the logic of the average_prices function to make sure it‚Äôs correctly calculating the volume-weighted average price and handling the order chains.
Test Case: Verify that the test case is correct. Make sure the expected output matches the actual output of the average_prices function for the given input.
If you‚Äôre still having trouble, please provide the implementation of the average_prices function and I‚Äôll be happy to help you debug it. üòä

I apologize for the confusion earlier. The error in the test case is due to the fact that the fill messages can refer to any new or modify message previously seen in the input messages. This means that a fill message can refer to an order id from a modify message, not just the original order id from a new message.

Here‚Äôs the corrected implementation of the average_prices function:

I apologize for the confusion. The error message indicates that the assertion in the run_test function failed, which means the output of the average_prices function did not match the expected output. This could be due to an issue in the average_prices function or in the test case itself.

The error message also mentions a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), which typically occurs when the program tries to read or write an incorrect location in memory. This could be caused by an out-of-bounds array index, a null pointer dereference, or other types of memory errors.

Without the actual implementation of the average_prices function, it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint the exact cause of the error. However, here are a few things you could check:

Memory Access: Make sure the program is not accessing memory it doesn‚Äôt own, such as going past the end of an array or dereferencing a null pointer.
Data Types: Ensure that all data types are correct. For example, make sure you‚Äôre not treating an integer as a pointer, or vice versa.
Logic Errors: Check the logic of the average_prices function to make sure it‚Äôs correctly calculating the volume-weighted average price and handling the order chains.
Test Case: Verify that the test case is correct. Make sure the expected output matches the actual output of the average_prices function for the given input.
If you‚Äôre still having trouble, please provide the implementation of the average_prices function and I‚Äôll be happy to help you debug it. üòä

Can you please help me debug it? assistant‚Äô I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let‚Äôs try to debug the issue.

The segmentation fault could be due to an attempt to access a non-existent order id in the orders map or id_mapping map. This could happen if a ‚Äúfill‚Äù message refers to an order id that has not been seen in a ‚Äúnew‚Äù or ‚Äúmodify‚Äù message.

To prevent this, we can add a check in the ‚Äúfill‚Äù message processing to ensure that the order id exists in the id_mapping map before trying to access it. Here‚Äôs the corrected implementation of the average_prices function:

# Question: Bike ride hydration
A cyclist rides a bike on a long, straight bicycle path.
He has one water bottle- initially full.
With a full bottle, he can ride at most "range" kilometres before passing out from dehydration.
Please implement the C++20 function...
```c++
int min_refills(int start_pos, int finish_pos, int range, const std::vector<int>& tap_positions)
...
```
such that it efficiently (in a big-O sense) calculates and returns the minimum number of times he'd need to refill his water bottle when riding from the "start" kilometre mark to the "finish" kilometre mark.
The kilometre positions of each tap where he can refill his bottle are provided in the "taps" argument.
If it's not possible to reach the intended finish mark, min_refills should return -1.
1. For example, a call to...
```c++
min_refills(10, 20, 4, {13, 17, 18, 22, 7 30})
8
9
10
11
...
```
models a desire to ride from the 10km mark and reach the 20km mark, an ability to ride 4 kms between refis, and taps at each of the 13, 17, 18, 22, and 30 kilometre marks.
Starting at the 10km mark, after refilling twice - at the 13km and 17km marks - he'll have enough water to reach his finish point at the 20km mark, so min_refills should return

2. Another examples:
min_refills(10, 25, 5, {13, 17, 18, 21, 22, 30}) should refill at 13, 17 or 18, 21 or 22kms => result 3.
NOTES
- all kilometre marks - start_pos, finish_pos and tap_positions (if any) - are in the range [0..1,000,000] inclusive - start <= finish, and tap_positions are distinct values in increasing order - range is in the range [1..1,000,000] km .
Please implement  the below min_refills function  in c++20 and it should be as efficient at it could be.
```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
int min_refills(int start_pos, int finish_pos, int range, const vector<int>& tap_positions) {
    // please implement this function...

}
int main()
{
    int start_pos, finish_pos, range;
    std::vector<int> tap_positions;

    assert(cin >> start_pos >> finish_pos >> range);
    int temp;
    while (cin >> temp) tap_positions.push_back(temp);
    assert(cin.eof());

    int result = min_refills(start_pos, finish_pos, range, tap_positions);

    if (std::ofstream fout{getenv("OUTPUT_PATH")})
        fout << result << "\n";
    else
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
```
Before providing the solution for the above question; can you please explain the question in simple step-by-step manner with simple example please.

Sure, I‚Äôd be happy to explain the problem in a step-by-step manner.

The problem is about a cyclist who is riding on a long, straight bicycle path. The cyclist has a water bottle that, when full, allows him to ride a certain distance before he needs to refill it. The distance he can ride with a full bottle is given by the variable range.

The cyclist starts at a certain position on the path (start_pos) and wants to reach another position (finish_pos). Along the path, there are several taps where he can refill his water bottle. The positions of these taps are given in the tap_positions vector.

The goal is to find the minimum number of times the cyclist needs to refill his water bottle in order to reach his destination. If it‚Äôs not possible for him to reach his destination (because the taps are too far apart), the function should return -1.

Here‚Äôs a simple example to illustrate the problem:

Let‚Äôs say the cyclist starts at position 10 (start_pos = 10), wants to reach position 20 (finish_pos = 20), and can ride 4 km with a full bottle (range = 4). There are taps at positions 13, 17, 18, 22, and 30 (tap_positions = {13, 17, 18, 22, 30}).

The cyclist starts at position 10 with a full bottle. He can ride 4 km before needing to refill, so he can reach position 14. The nearest tap is at position 13, so he stops there and refills his bottle.

Now, with a full bottle, he can ride another 4 km, which takes him to position 17. There‚Äôs a tap at this position, so he refills his bottle again.

With another full bottle, he can ride 4 km to position 21. However, his destination is at position 20, so he can stop there without needing to refill his bottle again.

So, in total, the cyclist needed to refill his bottle 2 times to reach his destination. Therefore, the function min_refills(10, 20, 4, {13, 17, 18, 22, 30}) should return 2. üòä

You
Thanks; now before implementation; can you please provide me the solution with an efficient algorithm in simple English ?
Copilot
Sure, here‚Äôs a step-by-step explanation of an efficient algorithm to solve this problem:

Initialization: Start by initializing a variable, say current_pos, to start_pos. This variable will keep track of the current position of the cyclist. Also, initialize a variable, say refills, to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of refills.
Traversal: Traverse through the tap_positions vector. For each tap position, check if the cyclist can reach it from current_pos with the water he currently has (i.e., if the difference between the tap position and current_pos is less than or equal to range). If he can, continue to the next tap position. If he can‚Äôt, it means he needs to refill at the previous tap position. In this case, increment refills by 1 and update current_pos to the previous tap position.
Final Check: After the traversal, check if the cyclist can reach finish_pos from current_pos with the water he currently has. If he can, return refills as the minimum number of refills needed. If he can‚Äôt, it means he needs to refill at the last tap position. In this case, increment refills by 1 and return it.
No Solution: If at any point during the traversal or the final check, the cyclist needs to refill but there‚Äôs no tap position to do so, return -1 to indicate that it‚Äôs not possible to reach the finish position.
This algorithm traverses the tap_positions vector only once, so its time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of tap positions. It also uses a constant amount of space, so its space complexity is O(1). üòä
