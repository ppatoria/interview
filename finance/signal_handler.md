This modular design ensures scalability and clarity, allowing for independent development and optimization of each component.
### **Design for Realtime Non-Blocking Data Ingestion and Processing System**

To receive and process **Protobuf** market data in a **non-blocking, parallel, multithreaded** manner, the system must efficiently handle incoming messages and ensure data is processed as it arrives, without delays, using parallelism and asynchronous methods where appropriate.

Here’s a design for how we can handle the **real-time, non-blocking** ingestion and processing, ensuring that the system can scale and perform well in high-frequency environments:

---

### **Key Design Components**

1. **Data Ingestion Layer (Adaptor Layer)**
   - **Role**: Adapts incoming market data from various sources (e.g., messaging systems, WebSockets, FIX) into a unified internal format (Protobuf).
   - **Design Considerations**: Each data source (e.g., Kafka, WebSocket, FIX) will have its own adaptor. The adaptors will ensure that data is passed to the core processing system in a **uniform** format.
   
2. **Reactor/Dispatcher**
   - **Role**: This component listens to the incoming data stream and dispatches the incoming Protobuf data to the **Processing Engine**.
   - **Non-blocking**: Utilizes **event-driven programming** or **Reactor pattern** to asynchronously receive data and forward it to the processing components.
   - **Thread Safety**: Ensures thread-safety using appropriate concurrency mechanisms such as **locks**, **atomic operations**, or **lock-free queues**.

3. **Data Queue/Buffer**
   - **Role**: Temporarily holds incoming messages from the Ingestion Layer (Adaptor) before they are passed to the processing pipeline.
   - **Non-blocking**: The queue should be thread-safe and support non-blocking operations, ideally using **lock-free queues** (e.g., **ConcurrentQueue** in C++ or **std::queue** with atomic operations).
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - **Ring Buffer** or **Circular Queue** for fixed-size buffering.
     - Supports high throughput with low overhead.

4. **Processing Engine**
   - **Role**: A **multi-threaded** component that processes the incoming market data in parallel, calculating indicators and evaluating rules based on the data.
   - **Non-blocking**: Utilizes **parallel execution** for independent tasks such as indicator calculation, signal generation, and rule evaluation.
   - **Design**:
     - **Task-based model**: Each task (such as calculating indicators or checking rules) is an independent unit of work, allowing parallel execution.
     - **Thread Pool**: Use a thread pool to handle task distribution. A thread pool ensures that the number of threads is managed efficiently, avoiding excessive thread creation overhead.
     - **Actor Model** or **Worker Model**: Independent threads handle different components of the processing pipeline (e.g., one thread for rule engine, another for indicator calculations).

5. **Output Layer**
   - **Role**: Once processing is complete, signals are generated and passed to the next stage (e.g., the Risk Manager or OMS). This layer will consume the processed signals and pass them forward.
   - **Design**: Output messages could be **queued**, passed directly to execution systems, or sent back to other components via another asynchronous queue.

---

### **Detailed Flow with Parallelism and Non-Blocking Design**

1. **Step 1: Data Reception** (via adaptors)
   - The **Adaptor Layer** receives data from various sources, e.g., Kafka, WebSockets, FIX protocol.
   - Data is deserialized into **Protobuf** format.
   - The adaptor will enqueue each incoming Protobuf message into the **Data Queue** for further processing. 

2. **Step 2: Reactor/Dispatcher** (Event-Driven)
   - The **Reactor/Dispatcher** listens to the **Data Queue**.
   - As messages arrive in the queue, the reactor triggers the processing pipeline in a **non-blocking** manner, ensuring that no thread is blocked while waiting for data.

3. **Step 3: Data Queue Management**
   - The queue holds incoming data temporarily. The **Reactor** dispatches tasks to the **Processing Engine** as soon as the data is ready.
   - **Thread-safe Queue**: Use a **lock-free queue** or **concurrent queue** to ensure that data can be enqueued and dequeued efficiently across multiple threads.

4. **Step 4: Parallel Processing**
   - As the **Processing Engine** processes data, each **task** (e.g., signal generation, rule evaluation) is assigned to a thread from the thread pool.
   - Tasks include:
     - **Indicator Calculations**: Moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.
     - **Signal Generation**: Rule engine evaluates buy/sell/hold signals based on indicators and market conditions.
     - **Risk Management**: Ensuring generated signals do not breach risk thresholds.
   
   - Each task runs independently, ensuring **parallel execution**.
     - **C++ Threads** or **C++ Tasking Libraries** like **std::async**, **std::thread**, or **Intel TBB (Threading Building Blocks)** can be used for task-based parallelism.

5. **Step 5: Non-blocking Data Flow**
   - If the system encounters heavy data throughput, **backpressure** can be applied to slow down producers (data sources) until the processing engine catches up.
   - The **event-driven** nature of the Reactor ensures that no threads are blocked, as tasks are immediately dispatched to available threads in the pool, maintaining high responsiveness.

6. **Step 6: Signal Output**
   - Once signals are generated, they are passed to the **Output Layer** via a **signal queue** or directly pushed to execution systems like **Risk Manager** or **OMS**.
   - Signals are generated and processed continuously as market data flows in.

### **Data Structure for Multi-Threading**

To ensure efficient **multi-threaded processing**, we need to focus on **non-blocking structures** for queues and task dispatching:

1. **Lock-Free Queue** (for data buffering):
   - A **lock-free circular queue** ensures high throughput and minimizes contention between threads.
   - It supports **multi-producer, multi-consumer** design, with a low latency for data writes and reads.

2. **Task Distribution** (for parallel processing):
   - Use a **task queue** and thread pool for distributing the computational load:
     - Each task is independent (indicator calculation, rule check).
     - **Thread Pool** can dynamically adjust the number of threads based on system load.

---

### **Threading and Synchronization**
- **Thread Pool**: A pool of worker threads is responsible for executing tasks in parallel.
  - For example, use **std::thread** or **Intel TBB** for dynamic task execution.
  - The pool maintains an optimal number of threads based on CPU load to ensure maximum efficiency without overloading the system.
  
- **Atomic Operations**:
  - For lightweight thread synchronization (such as incrementing counters), use **atomic operations** or **locks** (e.g., **std::mutex**).
