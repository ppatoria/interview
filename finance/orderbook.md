In a matching engine, orders are stored in a data structure that allows efficient retrieval and matching based on price levels and time priority.
Here's a high-level overview of how this is typically achieved:

1. **Order Book**: The order book is a data structure that maintains a list of buy and sell orders for a particular security.
It is usually divided into two parts: the buy side and the sell side.

2. **Price Levels**: Orders are grouped by price levels.
For each price level, there is a list of orders that have the same price.
This allows the matching engine to quickly find orders at the same price.

3. **Time Priority**: Within each price level, orders are sorted by their arrival time.
The first order to arrive at a particular price level has the highest priority.
This is known as the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

4. **Data Structures**: To efficiently store and retrieve orders, data structures such as heaps, priority queues, or balanced trees (e.g., AVL trees, red-black trees) are often used.
These structures allow for fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval of orders based on price and time priority.

5. **Matching Algorithm**: The matching algorithm continuously scans the order book to find matching buy and sell orders.
When a match is found, the orders are executed, and the resulting trade is recorded.

6. **Latency Management**: To ensure fairness and efficiency, the matching engine may implement latency management techniques such as 
- latency equalization and 
- proximity hosting.
These techniques help to minimize the impact of network latency on order execution.

By using these data structures and algorithms, the matching engine can efficiently handle a large number of orders while ensuring that orders are matched based on price and time priority.

Absolutely, let's extend the order book to show multiple orders at the same price level, with time priority taken into account.

### Extended Order Book Structure

#### Buy Orders (Bids)

| Price | Quantity | Time      |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 100.5 | 200      | 10:01:00  |
| 100.4 | 150      | 10:00:50  |
| 100.4 | 100      | 10:01:30  |
| 100.3 | 300      | 10:00:30  |

#### Sell Orders (Asks)

| Price | Quantity | Time      |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 101.0 | 50       | 10:01:10  |
| 101.2 | 200      | 10:00:45  |
| 101.2 | 150      | 10:01:15  |
| 101.3 | 150      | 10:00:20  |

In this example, we have multiple orders at the price levels of 100.4 for buy orders and 101.2 for sell orders. These orders are prioritized by time within each price level.

### Matching Engine Example with Extended Order Book

Let's say a new buy order comes in:

- **New Buy Order**: Price = 101.2, Quantity = 100, Time = 10:01:40

The matching engine will scan the sell orders to find a match. The new buy order (101.2) matches the sell orders at the price of 101.2. The orders are matched based on time priority.

#### Trade Example

1. The new buy order (101.2, 100) matches the first sell order at 101.2 (10:00:45):
   - **Executed Trade**: Price = 101.2, Quantity = 100
   - Remaining Sell Order: Price = 101.2, Quantity = 100 (because 200 - 100 = 100)

After this trade, the new buy order is fully executed. If the new buy order had a larger quantity, it would continue matching with the next sell order at the same price level.

Here's what the updated order book might look like after this trade:

#### Updated Buy Orders (Bids)

| Price | Quantity | Time      |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 100.5 | 200      | 10:01:00  |
| 100.4 | 150      | 10:00:50  |
| 100.4 | 100      | 10:01:30  |
| 100.3 | 300      | 10:00:30  |

#### Updated Sell Orders (Asks)

| Price | Quantity | Time      |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 101.0 | 50       | 10:01:10  |
| 101.2 | 100      | 10:00:45  |
| 101.2 | 150      | 10:01:15  |
| 101.3 | 150      | 10:00:20  |

Sure, let's extend the visual representation of the order book to include the types of data structures used for storing orders.

### Extended Order Book Visual Structure with Data Structures

#### Buy Orders (Bids)

- **Data Structure**: `std::map<double, std::queue<Order>>`

```
Price Level: 100.5 (std::map key)
  └── Order 1: {Quantity: 200, Time: 10:01:00} (std::queue element)

Price Level: 100.4 (std::map key)
  ├── Order 1: {Quantity: 150, Time: 10:00:50} (std::queue element)
  └── Order 2: {Quantity: 100, Time: 10:01:30} (std::queue element)

Price Level: 100.3 (std::map key)
  └── Order 1: {Quantity: 300, Time: 10:00:30} (std::queue element)
```

#### Sell Orders (Asks)

- **Data Structure**: `std::map<double, std::queue<Order>>`

```
Price Level: 101.0 (std::map key)
  └── Order 1: {Quantity: 50, Time: 10:01:10} (std::queue element)

Price Level: 101.2 (std::map key)
  ├── Order 1: {Quantity: 200, Time: 10:00:45} (std::queue element)
  └── Order 2: {Quantity: 150, Time: 10:01:15} (std::queue element)

Price Level: 101.3 (std::map key)
  └── Order 1: {Quantity: 150, Time: 10:00:20} (std::queue element)
```

### Data Structure Representation

- **Order Struct**: Represents an individual order with `price`, `quantity`, and `time`.
  ```cpp
  struct Order {
      double price;
      int quantity;
      std::string time; // Time is represented as a string for simplicity
  };
  ```

- **Order Book Maps**: `std::map` used to store orders at different price levels, ensuring orders are sorted by price.
  - **Key**: `double` representing the price level.
  - **Value**: `std::queue<Order>` representing the list of orders sorted by time priority within that price level.

This extended representation includes the types of data structures used, providing a clearer picture of how the order book is organized and managed.
