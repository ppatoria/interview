# OrderBook Overview
In a matching engine, orders are stored in a data structure that allows efficient retrieval and matching based on price levels and time priority.
Here's a high-level overview of how this is typically achieved:

1. **Order Book**: The order book is a data structure that maintains a list of buy and sell orders for a particular security.
It is usually divided into two parts: the buy side and the sell side.

2. **Price Levels**: Orders are grouped by price levels.
For each price level, there is a list of orders that have the same price.
This allows the matching engine to quickly find orders at the same price.

3. **Time Priority**: Within each price level, orders are sorted by their arrival time.
The first order to arrive at a particular price level has the highest priority.
This is known as the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

4. **Data Structures**: To efficiently store and retrieve orders, data structures such as heaps, priority queues, or balanced trees (e.g., AVL trees, red-black trees) are often used.
These structures allow for fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval of orders based on price and time priority.

5. **Matching Algorithm**: The matching algorithm continuously scans the order book to find matching buy and sell orders.
When a match is found, the orders are executed, and the resulting trade is recorded.

6. **Latency Management**: To ensure fairness and efficiency, the matching engine may implement latency management techniques such as 
- latency equalization and 
- proximity hosting.
These techniques help to minimize the impact of network latency on order execution.

By using these data structures and algorithms, the matching engine can efficiently handle a large number of orders while ensuring that orders are matched based on price and time priority.

Absolutely, let's extend the order book to show multiple orders at the same price level, with time priority taken into account.

### Extended Order Book Structure

#### Buy Orders (Bids)

| Price | Quantity | Time      |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 100.5 | 200      | 10:01:00  |
| 100.4 | 150      | 10:00:50  |
| 100.4 | 100      | 10:01:30  |
| 100.3 | 300      | 10:00:30  |

#### Sell Orders (Asks)

| Price | Quantity | Time      |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 101.0 | 50       | 10:01:10  |
| 101.2 | 200      | 10:00:45  |
| 101.2 | 150      | 10:01:15  |
| 101.3 | 150      | 10:00:20  |

In this example, we have multiple orders at the price levels of 100.4 for buy orders and 101.2 for sell orders. These orders are prioritized by time within each price level.

### Matching Engine Example with Extended Order Book

Let's say a new buy order comes in:

- **New Buy Order**: Price = 101.2, Quantity = 100, Time = 10:01:40

The matching engine will scan the sell orders to find a match. The new buy order (101.2) matches the sell orders at the price of 101.2. The orders are matched based on time priority.

#### Trade Example

1. The new buy order (101.2, 100) matches the first sell order at 101.2 (10:00:45):
   - **Executed Trade**: Price = 101.2, Quantity = 100
   - Remaining Sell Order: Price = 101.2, Quantity = 100 (because 200 - 100 = 100)

After this trade, the new buy order is fully executed. If the new buy order had a larger quantity, it would continue matching with the next sell order at the same price level.

Here's what the updated order book might look like after this trade:

#### Updated Buy Orders (Bids)

| Price | Quantity | Time      |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 100.5 | 200      | 10:01:00  |
| 100.4 | 150      | 10:00:50  |
| 100.4 | 100      | 10:01:30  |
| 100.3 | 300      | 10:00:30  |

#### Updated Sell Orders (Asks)

| Price | Quantity | Time      |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 101.0 | 50       | 10:01:10  |
| 101.2 | 100      | 10:00:45  |
| 101.2 | 150      | 10:01:15  |
| 101.3 | 150      | 10:00:20  |

Sure, let's extend the visual representation of the order book to include the types of data structures used for storing orders.

### Extended Order Book Visual Structure with Data Structures

#### Buy Orders (Bids)

- **Data Structure**: `std::map<double, std::queue<Order>>`

```
Price Level: 100.5 (std::map key)
  └── Order 1: {Quantity: 200, Time: 10:01:00} (std::queue element)

Price Level: 100.4 (std::map key)
  ├── Order 1: {Quantity: 150, Time: 10:00:50} (std::queue element)
  └── Order 2: {Quantity: 100, Time: 10:01:30} (std::queue element)

Price Level: 100.3 (std::map key)
  └── Order 1: {Quantity: 300, Time: 10:00:30} (std::queue element)
```

#### Sell Orders (Asks)

- **Data Structure**: `std::map<double, std::queue<Order>>`

```
Price Level: 101.0 (std::map key)
  └── Order 1: {Quantity: 50, Time: 10:01:10} (std::queue element)

Price Level: 101.2 (std::map key)
  ├── Order 1: {Quantity: 200, Time: 10:00:45} (std::queue element)
  └── Order 2: {Quantity: 150, Time: 10:01:15} (std::queue element)

Price Level: 101.3 (std::map key)
  └── Order 1: {Quantity: 150, Time: 10:00:20} (std::queue element)
```

### Data Structure Representation

- **Order Struct**: Represents an individual order with `price`, `quantity`, and `time`.
  ```cpp
  struct Order {
      double price;
      int quantity;
      std::string time; // Time is represented as a string for simplicity
  };
  ```

- **Order Book Maps**: `std::map` used to store orders at different price levels, ensuring orders are sorted by price.
  - **Key**: `double` representing the price level.
  - **Value**: `std::queue<Order>` representing the list of orders sorted by time priority within that price level.

This extended representation includes the types of data structures used, providing a clearer picture of how the order book is organized and managed.

| **IYou are correct to point out that a custom allocator does not guarantee **strictly contiguous allocation** in the way `std::vector` does. Let's clarify why `std::vector` remains generally more cache-friendly for traversal compared to a custom allocator applied to `std::list`:

---

### **Why `std::vector` is More Cache-Friendly**
1. **True Contiguous Allocation**:  
   - `std::vector` allocates memory for its elements in a strictly contiguous block, as mandated by the C++ standard.
   - This ensures sequential memory access during iteration, taking full advantage of spatial locality and reducing cache misses.

2. **Pointer-Free Access**:  
   - Accessing elements in a `std::vector` uses direct index arithmetic, which avoids the dereferencing overhead of pointers (common in `std::list`).
   - Pointer-based traversal in a custom allocator (even with contiguous chunks) still involves additional indirection.

3. **Memory Layout Predictability**:  
   - The layout of `std::vector` elements is predictable and compact, which makes prefetching by modern CPUs more effective.
   - In contrast, a custom allocator may distribute memory blocks across different regions depending on its design, reducing locality.

---

### **Custom Allocator with `std::list`**
While a custom allocator improves `std::list`’s cache locality compared to the default heap allocation:
1. **Chained Pointers in `std::list`**:  
   - Even with contiguous memory for nodes, `std::list` relies on pointers to link elements, introducing pointer dereferencing overhead.
2. **Fragmentation Risks**:  
   - Custom allocators might store chunks of memory contiguously, but they don't guarantee global contiguity across all nodes in the list.
3. **Less Compact Representation**:  
   - Each `std::list` node typically includes extra metadata (e.g., pointers to the next and previous nodes), which increases memory overhead and reduces cache efficiency.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **`std::vector` Advantage**: The strict contiguity and lack of pointer indirection make `std::vector` inherently better for cache-friendly traversal.
- **Custom Allocator Limitation**: While it mitigates some inefficiencies of `std::list`, it cannot match the strict contiguity and cache optimizations provided by `std::vector`.

| **2. Space Complexity**        | Overhead from `std::map` and `std::list`, plus memory pool of the custom allocator. Extra pointers per node in `std::list` add to space usage.                                                           | Lower space overhead due to `std::vector`’s compact representation.

However, `std::map` (tree-based) is not cache-friendly. | Cache-friendly due to contiguous memory layout of `std::vector`. However, `std::map` (tree-based) remains a cache inefficiency. Overall, `std::vector` is more cache-friendly than a custom allocator for traversal. |
| **4. Efficiency for Resizing** | Efficient due to the custom allocator pre-allocating and managing a contiguous memory pool. Resizing at a price level doesn't trigger frequent allocations.                                              | Less efficient during frequent resizes. `std::vector` requires reallocation when exceeding capacity, causing potential performance bottlenecks for dynamic resizing scenarios.                                       |
| **5. Scaling (large data)**    | Suitable for large-scale data due to the allocator's memory pool management. However, scaling is limited by `std::map`'s inherent inefficiencies for large datasets.                                     | Scales well for moderate-sized data. Memory efficiency of `std::vector` helps, but frequent resizes under high load can degrade performance. For massive data, hybrid needs careful tuning.                          |

### Key Insights

1. **Time Complexity**: 
   - Your implementation has faster deletion within price levels due to `std::list`'s constant-time removal. 
   - The hybrid approach suffers in deletion due to shifting overhead in `std::vector`.

2. **Space Complexity**: 
   - Your implementation incurs higher space overhead due to the tree-based structure of `std::map` and the node-based structure of `std::list`.
   - The hybrid approach is more space-efficient due to the compact storage of `std::vector`.

3. **Cache Friendliness**: 
   - Your custom allocator improves cache friendliness for orders but does not optimize `std::map` traversal.
   - The hybrid approach is more cache-friendly overall due to the natural contiguity of `std::vector`.

4. **Efficiency for Resizing**: 
   - Your custom allocator effectively handles resizing by managing a memory pool.
   - The hybrid approach can face performance degradation due to `std::vector` reallocation during frequent resizing.

5. **Scaling**: 
   - Your implementation is better suited for scenarios with frequent additions and deletions in high-volume trading due to its constant-time operations at the order level.
   - The hybrid approach is efficient for read-heavy workloads but may face challenges in write-heavy scenarios.

---

### Final Recommendation

- If **resizing efficiency** and **frequent updates** are critical, **your implementation with a custom allocator** is better due to its optimized deletion and contiguous memory management.
- If **cache friendliness**, **space efficiency**, and **read-heavy workloads** are prioritized, the **hybrid approach** is a strong alternative.

### **Comparison of `map + vector` vs `map + list (with custom allocator)`**

| Feature                  | **`std::map + std::vector`**                          | **`std::map + std::list (with Custom Allocator)`**         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cache Friendliness**   | High: `std::vector` stores orders in contiguous memory, optimizing cache usage during traversal within price levels. | Moderate: `std::list` incurs pointer dereferencing overhead even with a custom allocator. |
| **Insertion Efficiency** | Efficient at the end of a vector (`O(1)` amortized), but expensive for inserting into the middle (`O(n)` per price level). | Efficient (`O(1)` at any position within a price level) using iterators. |
| **Deletion Efficiency**  | Deleting elements requires shifting (`O(n)` per price level), but can be optimized for bulk deletions. | Efficient (`O(1)` per price level) using iterators. |
| **Modification Efficiency** | Fast for known indices (`O(1)` within a price level). | Fast (`O(1)` using iterators) but with slight overhead from pointer dereferencing. |
| **Space Efficiency**     | Minimal overhead; just element data and `std::map` node pointers. | Higher overhead due to `std::list` node pointers and allocator metadata. |
| **Traversal Efficiency** | Very fast due to the cache-friendly layout of `std::vector`. | Slower due to pointer chasing, even with a custom allocator. |
| **Resize Efficiency**    | Expensive if `std::vector` needs to grow (`O(n)` reallocation). | No reallocation overhead, as `std::list` dynamically manages memory. |
| **Handling Large Price Levels** | Best for small or moderate-sized price levels; performance degrades with large price levels. | Handles large price levels efficiently due to constant-time insertion and deletion. |
| **Use Case Suitability** | Suitable for workloads with frequent traversal and few modifications within price levels. | Suitable for workloads with frequent insertions/deletions or modifications within price levels. |

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

| Operation                | **`map + vector`**             | **`map + list (with custom allocator)`** |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Insertion (new price)    | `O(log m) + O(1)`             | `O(log m) + O(1)`                      |
| Insertion (existing price) | `O(log m) + O(n)`             | `O(log m) + O(1)`                      |
| Deletion (from price level) | `O(log m) + O(n)`             | `O(log m) + O(1)`                      |
| Traversal (all orders)   | `O(m + total_orders)`          | `O(m + total_orders)`                  |

Where:
- `m` = number of unique price levels.
- `n` = number of orders at a single price level.

---

### **Cache Friendliness**
- **`std::vector`**: Since the orders at a price level are stored contiguously, `std::vector` is highly cache-friendly during traversal. Iterating through all orders in a `std::vector` benefits from spatial locality.
- **`std::list` with Custom Allocator**: While a custom allocator can reduce memory fragmentation, it does not guarantee contiguous memory allocation. Traversal is less efficient due to pointer chasing.

---

### **Resize Scenarios**
- **`std::vector`**: Resizing can be expensive when a price level grows beyond the current capacity. However, this cost is amortized over multiple insertions.
- **`std::list`**: No resizing is required, as each node is allocated individually. This is advantageous for dynamic workloads with unpredictable growth.

---

### **Scaling**
- **`map + vector`**: Scales well for workloads with smaller price levels and frequent order matching, where traversal dominates.
- **`map + list`**: Scales better for workloads with large price levels and frequent insertions/deletions or modifications.
