Yes, **equity trading strategies** can be grouped based on their **execution characteristics**, and the **names** and categorization of these strategies can vary slightly across **different Investment Banks (IBs)**.
However, most of the strategies are generally classified into a few broad categories based on their **execution logic** and **objectives**.

Here’s how these strategies can be grouped:

---

### **1. **Execution Algorithms (Order Execution Strategies)**

These are strategies designed to execute an order in a way that minimizes costs or impact on the market, based on specific order execution needs.

- **Characteristics:** Focus on the **method** or **approach** used to execute orders with minimum market impact, including **price** and **time** optimization.

  - **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price):** Executes the order in line with volume throughout the day.
  - **TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price):** Executes the order evenly over time.
  - **Implementation Shortfall:** Aims to minimize the difference between the order's decision price and final execution price.
  - **Arrival Price:** Attempts to execute as close to the market price when the order is placed.

- **Common Name Variants Across IBs:**
  While the core strategies remain the same, some IBs may name their algorithms with slight variations, such as:
    - **VWAP** → **Volume Optimized Strategy**
    - **TWAP** → **Timed Execution Strategy**
    - **Implementation Shortfall** → **Cost Minimization Strategy**

---

### **2. **Smart Order Routing (SOR)**

These strategies focus on determining the best venues to execute orders (exchanges, dark pools, or other liquidity venues), often considering price, liquidity, and speed.

- **Characteristics:** Focuses on **finding the best execution venues** and often incorporates **multi-venue routing**.

  - **Smart Order Routing (SOR):** Selects the best liquidity venue for order execution.
  - **Liquidity Seeking:** Aimed at finding the best available liquidity across multiple venues.
  - **Dark Pool Trading:** Executes trades in dark pools to avoid market impact.

- **Common Name Variants Across IBs:**
  While SOR is the generic name, some IBs might use:
    - **Cross Venue Trading**
    - **Multi-Leg Routing**

---

### **3. **Liquidity-Oriented Strategies**

These strategies focus on executing large orders without moving the market price by targeting liquidity in specific venues or stocks.

- **Characteristics:** Designed to handle large orders, and they aim to achieve **minimal price slippage** and **efficient execution** without causing market disruptions.

  - **Percentage of Volume (POV):** Executes orders based on a specified percentage of overall market volume.
  - **Liquidity Seeking/Hidden Orders:** Executes orders using hidden or undisclosed orders in the market (dark pools).

- **Common Name Variants Across IBs:**
  These are often called by similar names but might be slightly adjusted:
    - **POV** → **Volume-Weighted Strategy**
    - **Liquidity Seeking** → **Dark Pool Seeking**

---

### **4. **Market Making and Providing Liquidity**

These strategies involve quoting prices and **making markets** by providing liquidity on both sides of the book (bid and ask), often with a goal to capture the spread.

- **Characteristics:** Involves creating a market for a stock by continuously providing both **buy** and **sell** prices.
  - **Market Making:** Involves quoting both bid and ask prices to provide liquidity.
  - **Quote-Driven Market Making:** Actively quoting prices to make profits from the bid-ask spread.

- **Common Name Variants Across IBs:**
  The names of these strategies are relatively consistent:
    - **Market Making**
    - **Liquidity Provider Strategy**

---

### **5. **Arbitrage Strategies**

These strategies attempt to profit from **price differences** between different markets or products. They involve simultaneously buying and selling correlated securities to exploit inefficiencies.

- **Characteristics:** Aimed at **profiting from discrepancies** in pricing or valuation between related instruments or across different venues.

  - **Statistical Arbitrage:** Profits from price inefficiencies using mathematical models.
  - **Pairs Trading:** Involves trading two highly correlated securities in opposite directions (long one, short the other).
  - **Index Arbitrage:** Exploiting price discrepancies between an index and its constituent stocks.

- **Common Name Variants Across IBs:**
  - **Arbitrage Strategies** are generally used interchangeably, but you might find names such as:
    - **Statistical Arbitrage** → **Quantitative Arbitrage**
    - **Pairs Trading** → **Relative Value Trading**

---

### **6. **Hedging Strategies**

These strategies involve using derivatives or other positions to **hedge risk** associated with an equity position or portfolio.

- **Characteristics:** Focuses on reducing risk or **protecting profits** by taking offsetting positions in related instruments.

  - **Equity Hedging:** Hedging an equity position with options or futures.
  - **Delta Neutral Hedging:** A type of options hedging that aims to neutralize price movements by holding offsetting positions.

- **Common Name Variants Across IBs:**
  While "Hedging" is the core term, some IBs may also refer to these as:
    - **Risk Management Strategies**
    - **Option Overlay Strategies**

---

### **7. **Trend-Following and Momentum Strategies**

These strategies are based on the idea that assets moving in one direction will likely continue in that direction for some time. They use **trend indicators** and **momentum metrics**.

- **Characteristics:** Focus on identifying and trading in the direction of the prevailing market trend.

  - **Momentum Strategy:** Takes advantage of trends by buying rising stocks or selling falling stocks.
  - **Trend Following:** Trades based on the direction of the market or asset over time.

- **Common Name Variants Across IBs:**
  Trend-following is typically referred to consistently:
    - **Momentum Strategy** → **Trend Continuation Strategy**
    - **Trend Following** → **Directional Trend Strategy**

---

### **8. **Statistical-Based Strategies (Quantitative Strategies)**

These strategies rely on statistical or mathematical models to make predictions about price movements.

- **Characteristics:** Use of complex models to predict price movements based on historical data or statistical relationships.

  - **Mean Reversion:** Strategy based on the assumption that asset prices will revert to their mean over time.
  - **Statistical Arbitrage:** Uses quantitative models to identify price discrepancies.

- **Common Name Variants Across IBs:**
  These names tend to be fairly consistent:
    - **Mean Reversion** → **Reversion to the Mean**
    - **Quantitative Strategies** → **Quantitative Trading Algorithms**

---

### **Conclusion:**
Although the **core strategy types** are relatively consistent, different investment banks may **name them differently** based on their proprietary algorithms, platforms, and execution systems. Generally, the **execution-based strategies** are more standardized across IBs, with names like **VWAP**, **TWAP**, and **SOR** being universal, while other strategies like **arbitrage** and **market making** can have slight variations in naming or structuring depending on the IB's systems.
