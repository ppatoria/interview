# How would you design a system to handle large amounts of incoming market data with minimal latency?
  Designing a system to handle large amounts of incoming market data with minimal latency is a complex task that involves several considerations.
  Here's a high-level approach:

  1. **Data Ingestion          :** Use a high-performance messaging system like Kafka or RabbitMQ to ingest the incoming data. These systems can handle high throughput and provide mechanisms for reliable delivery.
  2. **Data Processing         :** Use a stream processing system like Apache Flink or Apache Storm to process the data in real-time. These systems can handle large volumes of data with low latency.
  3. **Data Storage            :** Store the processed data in a high-performance database like Cassandra or HBase. These databases are designed to handle large amounts of data and provide low-latency access.
  4. **Concurrency             :** Use multi-threading and asynchronous programming to handle multiple data streams concurrently. This can significantly reduce latency.
  5. **Data Structures         :** Use appropriate data structures for efficient data access. For example, use a queue for FIFO access, a stack for LIFO access, a hash map for constant-time lookups, etc.
  6. **Memory Management       :** Use efficient memory management techniques to reduce latency. For example, use memory pools to avoid frequent memory allocation and deallocation.
  7. **Network Optimization    :** Use techniques like TCP/IP tuning, data compression, and batching to reduce network latency.
  8. **Hardware Considerations :** Use high-performance hardware and consider factors like CPU cache, disk I/O, network I/O, etc.

  Remember, the specific design would depend on the exact requirements of the system, including the volume of data, the required latency, the nature of the processing, etc.
  It's also important to consider factors like fault tolerance, scalability, and maintainability.

  In the context of C++, you would leverage its low-level capabilities to manage memory, optimize performance, and handle concurrency.
  For example, you might use smart pointers for automatic and deterministic memory management, STL containers for efficient data structures, and C++11 threading facilities for multi-threading.

# Write a function to reverse a string in place in C++.
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

/**
 * Write a function to reverse a string in place in C++.
 */
string reverse(string str){
    auto begin = str.begin();
    auto end   = str.end() - 1;

    while(begin < end){
        std::swap(*begin, *end);
        begin++; end--;
    }
    return str;
}

int main(){
    std::string str("abcd");
    cout << reverse(str) << endl;
    std::reverse(str.begin(), str.end());
    cout << str << endl;
}
```
- **std::swap syntax and possible implementation**:
     ```
     template <typename T>
     void swap(T& a, T& b) {
        T temp = std::move(a);
        a = std::move(b);
        b = std::move(temp);
        }
    ```
- **Time complexity**  : O(N), where N is the length of the string. This is because each character in the string is visited once.
- **Space complexity** : O(1**, as no extra space is used.

# How would you implement a circular buffer in C++?

**Data Structure:**

* The circular buffer is implemented as an array of fixed size `buffer_size`.
* Two pointers are used to track the head and tail of the buffer:
    * `head`: Points to the location where the next element will be written.
    * `tail`: Points to the location of the element that will be read next (or the oldest element in the buffer).

**Operations:**

1. **Initialization:**
    * Allocate memory for the buffer of size `buffer_size`.
    * Set both `head` and `tail` to point to the beginning of the buffer (index 0).

2. **IsEmpty:**
    * Check if `head == tail`. This indicates the buffer is empty because both pointers are at the same location with no data between them.

3. **IsFull:**
    * Due to the circular nature, a special check is needed to differentiate between a full and partially filled buffer.
    * Check if `(head + 1) % buffer_size == tail`. This condition holds true only when the next position after `head` (considering wrapping around) would be the current `tail`, indicating a full buffer.

4. **Enqueue (Write):**
    * If the buffer is full (based on the `IsFull` check), handle the overflow condition (e.g., signal an error or overwrite the oldest element).
    * Write the new element to the location pointed to by `head`.
    * Increment `head` by 1 (wrapping around to the beginning if it reaches `buffer_size`).

5. **Dequeue (Read):**
    * If the buffer is empty (based on the `IsEmpty` check), handle the underflow condition (e.g., signal an error or return a special value).
    * Read the element from the location pointed to by `tail`.
    * Increment `tail` by 1 (wrapping around to the beginning if it reaches `buffer_size`).

**Additional Notes:**

* The modulo operator (`%`) is used for wrapping around the buffer indices to maintain the circular behavior.
* You can choose to handle overflow and underflow conditions in different ways depending on your specific application.
* This algorithm provides a basic framework for a circular buffer. Additional features like mutexes or semaphores can be added for thread-safe operation in multi-threaded environments.

#include <iostream>
#include <array>

using namespace std;

template <typename T, int SIZE>
class CircularBuffer {
public:
  CircularBuffer() : head(0), tail(0) {}

  bool isEmpty() const {
    return head == tail;
  }

    return (head + 1) % SIZE == tail;
  }

  void write(const T& data) {
    buffer[head] = data;
    head = (head + 1) % SIZE;
    if (isFull()) {
      std::cout << "Notify all that buffer is full!" << std::endl;

    T data = buffer[tail];
    tail = (tail + 1) % SIZE;

    }
    return data;
  }

int main() {
  CircularBuffer<int, 5> buffer;

  buffer.write(1);
  buffer.write(2);
  buffer.write(3);
  buffer.write(4);
  buffer.write(5);

  std::cout << buffer.read() << std::endl; // Output: 1
  std::cout << buffer.read() << std::endl; // Output: 2
  std::cout << buffer.read() << std::endl; // Output: 3
  std::cout << buffer.read() << std::endl; // Output: 4
  std::cout << buffer.read() << std::endl; // Output: 5

  return 0;

Alternative Implementation.

#include <array>

template<typename T, size_t SIZE>
class CircularBuffer {
public:
    CircularBuffer() : head(0), tail(0), full(false) {}

    void write(T item) {
        buffer[head] = item;
        if (full) tail = (tail + 1) % SIZE;
        head = (head + 1) % SIZE;
        full = head == tail;
    }

    T read() {
        if (isEmpty()) return T();
        T item = buffer[tail];
        full = false;
        tail = (tail + 1) % SIZE;
        return item;
    }

    bool isEmpty() const {
        return (!full && (head == tail));
    }

    bool isFull() const {
        return full;
    }

private:
    std::array<T, SIZE> buffer;
    size_t head;
    size_t tail;
    bool full;
};
