`std::any` is a feature introduced in C++17 that provides a type-safe container for single values of any type.
Here's a detailed explanation:

### Design and Purpose:
- **Design**  : `std::any` can hold a value of any copy constructible type or be empty, referred to as its state.
The statement "a type-safe container for single values of any type"
refers to `std::any`'s ability to store a single value of any copyable type while ensuring type safety.
This means that you can store an integer, a string, a custom object, or any other copyable type in an `std::any` object,
and the type will be checked at runtime when you try to retrieve or manipulate the stored value.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```cpp
#include <any>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::any a = 10; // Storing an integer
    std::cout << std::any_cast<int>(a) << '\n'; // Correctly casts to int

    a = std::string("Hello"); // Now storing a string
    std::cout << std::any_cast<std::string>(a) << '\n'; // Correctly casts to string

    // Attempting to cast to the wrong type will throw an exception
    try {
        std::cout << std::any_cast<float>(a) << '\n';
    } catch (const std::bad_any_cast& e) {
        std::cout << e.what() << '\n'; // Outputs: bad any_cast
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:
- We first store an `int` in `std::any` and then retrieve it using `std::any_cast<int>`.
- We then store a `std::string` in the same `std::any` object and retrieve it using `std::any_cast<std::string>`.
- If we try to retrieve the value as a `float`, which is not the type stored, `std::any_cast` throws a `std::bad_any_cast` exception,
  demonstrating the type safety provided by `std::any`.

This type safety is what distinguishes `std::any` from using `void*` for type-agnostic storage,
where you would have no built-in mechanism to ensure that the retrieved type matches the stored type,
potentially leading to undefined behavior.
`std::any` provides a safe and flexible way to store and work with values of any type.

The statement "`std::any` can hold a value of any copy constructible type or be empty" means
that `std::any` is capable of storing any type that has a copy constructor,
which is a constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.
The "state" of `std::any` refers to whether it currently holds a value (and what type) or if it is empty (holds no value).

The purpose of this design is to provide a flexible container that can safely hold a single value of any type that meets the copy constructible requirement,
while also providing the ability to be in a well-defined, empty state.

Regarding types with deleted copy constructors and assignment operators.
If a type has its copy constructor or copy assignment operator deleted, it cannot be stored in `std::any`.
This is because `std::any` relies on the ability to copy the contained value to ensure that it can manage the value it holds correctly,
especially when it comes to operations like copying or moving an `std::any` object.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```cpp
#include <any>
#include <iostream>

class NonCopyable {
public:
    NonCopyable() = default;
    NonCopyable(const NonCopyable&) = delete; // Deleted copy constructor
    NonCopyable& operator=(const NonCopyable&) = delete; // Deleted copy assignment operator
};

int main() {
    // std::any a = NonCopyable(); // This line would cause a compilation error

    std::any b = 42; // This works because int is copy constructible
    std::cout << std::any_cast<int>(b) << '\n'; // Outputs: 42

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, attempting to store an instance of `NonCopyable` in `std::any` would result in a compilation error because `NonCopyable` cannot be copied.
However, storing an `int` works fine because `int` is a copy constructible type.
This demonstrates the requirement for types stored in `std::any` to be copy constructible.

`std::any` is designed to hold values of any type that is copy constructible.
This means that the type must have a copy constructor that is accessible and not deleted.
If a type has a move constructor and move assignment operator but has its copy constructor and copy assignment operator deleted,
it cannot be directly held in an `std::any`.
This is because `std::any` requires the ability to copy the contained object,
at least potentially, for its own copy construction and copy assignment operations.

However, there are ways to work around this limitation.
For example, you can wrap the move-only type in a `std::shared_ptr` or another type that is copyable and store that in the `std::any` instead.
Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <any>
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>

class MoveOnlyType {
public:
    MoveOnlyType() = default;
    MoveOnlyType(const MoveOnlyType&) = delete;
    MoveOnlyType& operator=(const MoveOnlyType&) = delete;
    MoveOnlyType(MoveOnlyType&&) = default; // Move constructor
    MoveOnlyType& operator=(MoveOnlyType&&) = default; // Move assignment operator

    void sayHello() const { std::cout << "Hello from MoveOnlyType!" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    std::any a = std::make_shared<MoveOnlyType>(); // Wrapping in shared_ptr

    // Accessing the MoveOnlyType through the shared_ptr stored in std::any
    std::shared_ptr<MoveOnlyType> ptr = std::any_cast<std::shared_ptr<MoveOnlyType>>(a);
    ptr->sayHello(); // Outputs: Hello from MoveOnlyType!

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `MoveOnlyType` is a move-only type, but we can store it in `std::any` by wrapping it in a `std::shared_ptr`, which is copyable.
This allows us to use move-only types with `std::any` indirectly.

- **Purpose** : It's designed to store values of any type in a type-safe way, serving as a safer alternative to `void*`.

### Implementation Under the Hood:
- **Storage**                   : Internally, `std::any` uses dynamic storage to hold the contained object, which allows it to store any type.
- **Type-Safety**               : It maintains type safety by keeping type information alongside the stored value, allowing for safe retrieval with `std::any_cast`.
- **Small Object Optimization** : Implementations may optimize storage for small objects to avoid dynamic allocation, but this is not guaranteed.

### Efficiency:
- **Runtime Overhead** : `std::any` introduces overhead due to type erasure and dynamic storage management.
- **Memory Usage**     : It may use more memory than a statically typed variable due to the need to store type information and potential dynamic allocation.

### When to Use:
- **Dynamic Type Storage**               : When you need to store objects of unknown types at compile-time.
- **Type-Safe Heterogeneous Containers** : When creating containers that can hold different types of objects in a type-safe manner.
- **Library Interfaces**                 : When designing libraries that interact with user-defined types without knowing them in advance.

### When Not to Use (Alternatives):
- **Known Types**           : If the set of types is known at compile-time, `std::variant` is a better choice.
- **Single Optional Value** : For a single potentially absent value, `std::optional` is more appropriate.
- **Polymorphism**          : If objects share a common interface, traditional polymorphism with base classes and virtual functions might be more suitable.
- **Performance Critical**  : In performance-critical code, the overhead of `std::any` might be undesirable, and direct use of types or other mechanisms may be preferred.

In summary, `std::any` is a versatile tool for type-agnostic storage,
but it comes with trade-offs in terms of performance and should be used judiciously when the benefits outweigh the costs.
It's particularly useful in scenarios where type flexibility is required,
such as interfacing with dynamic or scripting languages, or when building libraries that must operate on user-defined types.
However, when type information is known or when performance is critical,
alternatives like `std::variant`, `std::optional`, or traditional polymorphism may be more appropriate.
