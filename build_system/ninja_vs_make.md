### **Ninja vs. Make: A Detailed Comparison**  

Ninja and Make are both build systems used to compile and manage software projects efficiently, but they differ in their design, philosophy, and performance.  

---

## **1. How Ninja Works in Two Steps**  
Unlike Make, which directly reads a `Makefile` and builds projects, **Ninja follows a two-step process**:

1. **Step 1: Dependency Graph Generation (External Build System Required)**  
   - Ninja **does not generate** its own dependency graph.  
   - It relies on **CMake, Meson, or other build systems** to generate a `.ninja` build file.  
   - The `.ninja` file contains **explicit rules and dependencies** for all targets.  

2. **Step 2: Efficient Incremental Builds (Execution Phase)**  
   - Ninja reads the `.ninja` file and executes the build as efficiently as possible.  
   - It keeps track of **timestamps** and **minimal changes** to rebuild only necessary parts.  

This makes Ninja **dependent on an external build system** (like CMake) to create the initial build rules.

## **2. Why Ninja is More Efficient than Make**  
| Feature                 | **Make** | **Ninja** |
|-------------------------|---------|-----------|
| **Parsing Overhead** | High, re-parses Makefile every run | Minimal, pre-generated `.ninja` file |
| **Dependency Graph** | Dynamically resolved | Precomputed by CMake/Meson |
| **Incremental Builds** | Checks timestamps for all files | Only rebuilds necessary files |
| **Parallelism** | Uses `-j` flag, but inefficient scheduling | **Maximally parallel**, better task scheduling |
| **Rebuild Detection** | Sometimes inaccurate, may require `make clean` | Highly accurate, no unnecessary recompilations |
| **Startup Time** | Slower, due to Makefile evaluation | Extremely fast |
| **File System Calls** | More frequent (recursive checking) | Minimal, direct execution |

### **Key Advantages of Ninja**  
- **Minimal Parsing Overhead**: No recursive parsing of dependencies like Make.  
- **Faster Incremental Builds**: Because it only rebuilds **necessary** parts.  
- **Better Parallelism**: Can fully utilize multi-core processors.  
- **Precise Dependency Tracking**: Unlike Make, which sometimes needs a full rebuild.

## **3. Why Ninja is Not Independent (Dependency on CMake and Others)**  
- Ninja **cannot** create its own build rules.  
- It **requires** a separate build system (like **CMake, Meson, or GN**) to **generate the dependency graph**.  
- **CMake generates `.ninja` files**, which Ninja then executes efficiently.  
- In contrast, **Make can function independently** by manually writing a `Makefile`.  

### **Example Workflow (CMake + Ninja)**
```sh
cmake -G "Ninja" -B build
ninja -C build
```
Here, CMake **generates** the `.ninja` build script, and then Ninja **executes** it.

## **4. Key Differences: Ninja vs. Make**
| Feature                | **Make**                          | **Ninja** |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| **Independence**       | Standalone (can write Makefiles) | **Not standalone** (needs CMake/Meson) |
| **Efficiency**         | Slower, re-parses dependencies   | **Fast**, precomputed dependencies |
| **Incremental Builds** | Less precise, may require cleanup | **Accurate**, no unnecessary rebuilds |
| **Parallelism**        | Basic (`-j` flag)                | **Optimized parallel execution** |
| **File System Calls**  | Recursively checks dependencies  | Minimal calls, efficient execution |
| **Build System Role**  | Both dependency generation & execution | **Only execution**, relies on external tools |
| **Portability**        | Unix-based, Windows support via MinGW | **Cross-platform** |

## **5. When to Use Ninja vs. Make**
- **Use Make if**:
  - You need a **self-contained build system**.
  - Your project is small, and build times aren't a major issue.
  - You are working on legacy systems.

- **Use Ninja if**:
  - You want **fast incremental builds**.
  - You are working on **large projects** (e.g., Chromium, LLVM).
  - You are already using **CMake/Meson** and want a better backend.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Ninja is not a replacement for CMake or Meson**â€”it only optimizes build execution.  
- It is **faster than Make** because it avoids unnecessary re-parsing, performs better dependency tracking, and supports efficient parallel execution.  
- However, **it is not independent** like Make and must rely on an external tool like CMake to generate its build files.
