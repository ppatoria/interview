3. **Implementing the Fibonacci Sequence in Three Different Methods (Python Algorithms)**:
   - Write three different Python functions to generate the Fibonacci sequence: using recursion, dynamic programming, and an iterative approach.
   ```0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....```

Certainly! Let's explore three different methods to generate the Fibonacci sequence in Python: using recursion, dynamic programming, and an iterative approach.

1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - The recursive method calculates Fibonacci numbers by summing the previous two terms.
   - It's simple but can be inefficient due to redundant calculations.
   - Here's a Python function using recursion to find the nth Fibonacci number:

```python
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci_recursive(n - 1) + fibonacci_recursive(n - 2)

# Example usage
n = 6
print(f"Fibonacci({n}) =", fibonacci_recursive(n))
```

2. **Dynamic Programming (Memoization) Approach**:
   - We'll use memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
   - This approach is more efficient than pure recursion.
   - Here's a Python function using memoization:

```python
def fibonacci_memoization(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n < 2:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memoization(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci_memoization(n - 2, memo)
    return memo[n]

# Example usage
n = 6
print(f"Fibonacci({n}) =", fibonacci_memoization(n))
```

3. **Iterative Approach**:
   - We'll compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively using a loop.
   - This approach is efficient and avoids recursion overhead.
   - Here's a Python function using iteration:

```python
def fibonacci_iterative(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    first, second = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        first, second = second, first + second
    return second

# Example usage
n = 6
print(f"Fibonacci({n}) =", fibonacci_iterative(n))
```

Choose the method that best suits your needs based on efficiency and readability. 🚀👩‍💻
