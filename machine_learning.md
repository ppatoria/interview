4. **Machine Learning (Easy)**:
   - Solve a machine learning problem related to a specific dataset or algorithm. The exact details may vary.
   A classic problem: **predicting whether an email is spam or not**. This problem is commonly known as **email spam classification**.

## Email Spam Classification Problem

### Problem Description:
Given a dataset of emails, we want to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether an email is spam (unwanted, promotional, or malicious) or not (legitimate).

### Example Dataset:
Suppose we have a labeled dataset with the following features for each email:
- **Subject Line**: The subject line of the email.
- **Body Text**: The content of the email.
- **Label**: Whether the email is spam (1) or not (0).

### Machine Learning Task:
This is a **binary classification** task. We want to train a model to predict the label (spam or not) based on the email features.

### Algorithms to Use:
We can start with simple algorithms like **Na√Øve Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, or **Random Forest**. These are suitable for beginners and provide good results for email spam classification.

### Evaluation Metric:
We can use metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** to evaluate the model's performance.

### Python Code Example:
```python
# Load the dataset (you can use your own dataset)
# Preprocess the text data (tokenization, removing stop words, etc.)
# Split the data into training and testing sets
# Train a machine learning model (e.g., Na√Øve Bayes)
# Evaluate the model's performance
# Make predictions on new emails
```

Remember that this is just one example, and there are many other machine learning problems you can explore. Feel free to adapt this problem or choose a different one based on your interests! üöÄüë©‚Äçüíª
