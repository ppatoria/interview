# Rc 
## Question: Why Rc require borrow checker as it is created to work on single thread ?
The borrow checker in Rust is a key part of ensuring memory safety and preventing data races, even in single-threaded contexts. Here’s why `Rc` (Reference Counted) still requires the borrow checker:

### 1. Ensuring Safe Access
Even though `Rc` is used in single-threaded contexts, the borrow checker helps prevent common issues like:
- **Dangling References**: When an object is dropped while references to it still exist.
- **Aliasing and Mutation**: Ensuring that data cannot be mutated while there are immutable references to it, avoiding undefined behavior.

### 2. Reference Counting Safety
The borrow checker helps maintain the integrity of the reference count:
- **Immutable References (`&T`)**: Multiple parts of your program can read the data without concern for data races.
- **Mutable References (`&mut T`)**: Ensures only one part of your program can mutate the data at a time, ensuring data integrity.

### Example in Rust

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let data = Rc::new(5);
    {
        let data_clone = Rc::clone(&data);
        println!("Data: {}", data_clone);
        // The reference count is 2 here
    } // data_clone goes out of scope, reference count decreases to 1
    println!("Data: {}", data);
}
```

### Example in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr<int> data = std::make_shared<int>(5);
    {
        std::shared_ptr<int> data_clone = data;
        std::cout << "Data: " << *data_clone << std::endl;
        // The use count is 2 here
    } // data_clone goes out of scope, use count decreases to 1
    std::cout << "Data: " << *data << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Comparison: Advantages and Disadvantages

**Rust `Rc`**
- **Advantages**
  - **Memory Safety**     : The borrow checker enforces strict rules, preventing data races and ensuring safe memory access.
  - **Clear Ownership**   : The borrow checker clarifies who owns what data, making it easier to reason about the program.
- **Disadvantages**
  - **Learning Curve**    : Rust’s ownership rules and the borrow checker can be complex for new users.
  - **Less Flexibility**  : The strict rules can sometimes be restrictive, requiring workarounds for certain patterns.

**C++ `std::shared_ptr`**
- **Advantages**
  - **Flexibility**       : More flexible in how memory is managed and shared.
  - **Familiarity**       : Familiar to developers used to traditional C++ memory management.
- **Disadvantages**
  - **Manual Management** : Requires careful management to avoid pitfalls like cyclic references.
  - **Safety**            : Lacks the compile-time guarantees of Rust, requiring runtime checks and potential for data races.

In summary, while `Rc` is designed for single-threaded contexts, the borrow checker ensures the same level of safety and integrity that Rust enforces across the board. This helps maintain Rust's guarantees of preventing undefined behavior and ensuring safe memory access.
