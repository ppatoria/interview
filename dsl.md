# Given a std::string containing the source code for a function call and arguments, C++ Standard Library functions let you evaluate the function call and save the results in another string:
This is not possible with the C++ Standard Library.
C++ does not support this kind of reflection or interpretation.
Although, it is possible to evaluate a string as code at runtime in C++ using third-party libraries.
One such library is `cling`, an interactive C++ interpreter built on top of `clang` and `llvm`. With `cling`, you can parse and execute a string of C++ code at runtime.

## Third Party Libraries:
However, please note that using such libraries can add complexity to your code and may have security implications, as executing code from a string can potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.
Always make sure to validate and sanitize any input you plan to execute as code.

1. A simple example of how you might use `cling` to evaluate a string of C++ code:

```cpp
#include <cling/Interpreter/Interpreter.h>
#include <cling/Interpreter/Value.h>

int main() {
    cling::Interpreter interp(cling::Interpreter::kCling);
    cling::Value result;
    interp.process("int x = 5; int y = 7; x + y;", &result);
    std::cout << *result << std::endl;  // Outputs: 12
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `interp.process` evaluates the string of C++ code and stores the result in `result`.
The code in the string declares two integers `x` and `y`, and computes their sum.

## Embedded Scripting Environments:
Libraries like Lua or Squirrel can be embedded in C++ applications.
You can pass your string representation of the function call to the scripting engine, which interprets and executes the code within a controlled environment.
This approach offers more flexibility but requires careful integration and management of the embedded scripting environment.
