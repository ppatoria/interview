Here's a **tabular comparison** of techniques used in equity trading, highlighting their focus, key tools, and advantages:

| **Technique**               | **Focus**                         | **Key Tools/Methods**                                                                     | **Advantages**                                             | **Disadvantages**                                        |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Heuristic Techniques**    | Rules of thumb and approximations | Moving averages, candlestick patterns, RSI, support/resistance levels                     | Fast decision-making, simple to implement                  | Prone to biases, lacks precision in volatile markets     |
| **Technical Analysis**      | Historical price trends           | Chart patterns, indicators (MACD, RSI), moving averages, volume analysis                  | Effective for short-term trading, visual insights          | Relies heavily on past data, may miss fundamental shifts |
| **Fundamental Analysis**    | Intrinsic value assessment        | Financial ratios (P/E, ROE), DCF models, qualitative factors (management, moat)           | Long-term focus, deeper understanding of business value    | Time-intensive, less effective for short-term trading    |
| **Quantitative Techniques** | Mathematical/statistical modeling | Monte Carlo simulations, factor models, machine learning, portfolio optimization          | Data-driven, handles large datasets, scalable              | Complex implementation, requires advanced expertise      |
| **Algorithmic Trading**     | Automated trade execution         | VWAP/TWAP, Iceberg orders, statistical arbitrage, execution algorithms                    | High speed, minimizes human error                          | Infrastructure costs, prone to market anomalies          |
| **High-Frequency Trading**  | Ultra-fast trades                 | Co-location, latency-sensitive strategies, market making                                  | Profit from small price differences, provides liquidity    | High costs, regulatory scrutiny, requires robust systems |
| **Sentiment Analysis**      | Market sentiment and mood         | NLP, text mining, alternative data (e.g., social media, earnings transcripts)             | Captures soft data, identifies trends quickly              | Subject to noise, may misinterpret data                  |
| **Risk Management**         | Limiting losses and managing risk | Stop-loss, VaR, position sizing, hedging (options/futures)                                | Protects capital, supports sustainable trading             | May reduce potential gains, depends on accurate metrics  |
| **Behavioral Finance**      | Understanding market psychology   | Bias analysis (herd behavior, loss aversion), exploiting anomalies (e.g., January effect) | Accounts for irrational behavior, identifies anomalies     | Difficult to model, less predictive in rational markets  |
| **Derivative Strategies**   | Leveraging options/futures        | Covered calls, protective puts, spreads, straddles                                        | Advanced hedging/speculation, limits risk or boosts income | Complex, high transaction costs, requires expertise      |

### **Summary**
- **Short-Term Focus**: Techniques like technical analysis, algorithmic trading, and high-frequency trading dominate.  
- **Long-Term Focus**: Fundamental analysis and derivative strategies are key.  
- **Balanced Approach**: Combining quantitative, heuristic, and risk management techniques enhances robustness.  

This comparison helps traders and analysts choose methods suited to their objectives, resources, and expertise level.
Here’s a breakdown of the trading techniques based on their suitability for **short-term trading** (typically involving frequent buying and selling to profit from market fluctuations) versus **long-term investing** (focused on holding assets to realize value over time):

| **Technical Analysis**     | ✅ Suitable             | ❌ Not Ideal            | Relies on historical price patterns and indicators to predict near-term trends.                     |
| **Fundamental Analysis**   | ❌ Less Useful          | ✅ Suitable             | Evaluates intrinsic value, focusing on financials and qualitative factors for long-term growth.      |
| **Quantitative Techniques**| ✅ Suitable             | ✅ Suitable             | Models can be adapted for both trading (e.g., statistical arbitrage) and investing (e.g., portfolio optimization). |
| **Algorithmic Trading**    | ✅ Suitable             | ❌ Not Ideal            | Primarily used for high-speed, automated trade execution in the short term.                         |

| **Derivative Strategies**  | ✅ Suitable             | ✅ Suitable             | Short-term: Speculative strategies (e.g., spreads, straddles). Long-term: Hedging against risks.     |

### **Summary**
- **Short-Term Trading**:  
   Primarily relies on **heuristics, technical analysis, algorithmic trading, high-frequency trading, and quantitative models** tailored for immediate price action.  

- **Long-Term Investing**:  
   Dominated by **fundamental analysis**, with support from **quantitative models, risk management, sentiment analysis, and derivatives for hedging**.

---

### **Hybrid Techniques**  
- **Quantitative Techniques**, **Sentiment Analysis**, and **Behavioral Finance** are versatile and can be adapted for both short-term trading and long-term investment strategies, depending on implementation.  
- **Risk Management** is universally important to both approaches.
