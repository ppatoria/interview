# A container providing iterators is functionally more flexible than one providing "void visit(auto functor_to_call_for_each_node)" instead
Yes, Iterators provide more flexibility as they allow the user of the container to control the traversal, whereas a visit function encapsulates the traversal within the container.
let's consider a simple example of a list of integers and we want to find a specific value in the list.
If we have an iterator, we can control the traversal and stop when we find the value. Here is a C++ example:

```cpp
std::list<int> myList = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int valueToFind = 3;
for(auto it = myList.begin(); it != myList.end(); ++it) {
    if(*it == valueToFind) {
        std::cout << "Found " << valueToFind << std::endl;
        break;
    }
}
```

In this case, we have full control over the traversal.
We can decide when to start, when to stop, and what to do at each step.

On the other hand, if we only have a `visit` function, we can't control the traversal in the same way.
The `visit` function would look something like this:

```cpp
void visit(std::list<int>& myList, std::function<void(int)> functor) {
    for(const auto& value : myList) {
        functor(value);
    }
}
```

And we would use it like this:

```cpp
visit(myList, [](int value) {
    if(value == valueToFind) {
        std::cout << "Found " << valueToFind << std::endl;
        // But we can't stop the traversal here!
    }
});
```

As you can see, with the `visit` function, we don't have the same level of control.
We can't stop the traversal when we find the value.
The `visit` function will always go through every element in the list.

This is a simple example, but it illustrates the point.
Iterators provide more flexibility because they give the user more control over the traversal.
This can be very useful in more complex scenarios where the user might want to control the traversal in ways that the `visit` function doesn't allow.
For example, the user might want to skip certain elements, or stop the traversal under certain conditions, or traverse the elements in a non-linear order.
These things are not possible with a `visit` function.
So while a `visit` function can be simpler and easier to use in some cases, an iterator is generally more flexible.
