# How would you implement a binary search tree in C++?
## Algorithm for Creating a Binary Search Tree (BST)

  **Data Structure:**

  * A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure where each node contains a key value.
  * The key values follow a specific order:
      * Every node's left child has a key value **less than** the parent node's key.
      * Every node's right child has a key value **greater than** the parent node's key.

  **Operations:**

  1. **Initialization:** Create an empty tree (a null pointer).

  2. **Insertion:**
    * **Base Case:** If the tree is empty (root is null), create a new node with the key value to be inserted and set it as the root.
    * **Recursive Case:**
      * Compare the key value to be inserted with the current node's key:
          * If the key to be inserted is **less than** the current node's key, recursively call the insertion function on the left subtree.
          * If the key to be inserted is **greater than** the current node's key, recursively call the insertion function on the right subtree.
      * After the recursive call, the returned subtree becomes the appropriate child of the current node.

## Implementation:

  ```c++
  #include <iostream>
  #include <memory>

  using namespace std;

  template<typename T>
  class BST{
      private:
          struct node{
              node* left;
              node* right;
              T data;

          node(const T& _data) : data(_data), left(nullptr), right(nullptr)
          {}

          };

          node* head;

      private:

          bool isEmpty(){
              return head == nullptr;
          }

          node* insert(node*& root, const T& data){
              if(root == nullptr){
                  root = new node(data);
                  return root;
              }

              if(root->data == data)
                  return root;

              if(data < root->data)
                  return insert(root->left, data);
              else
                  return insert(root->right, data);
          }

          node* search(node* root, const T& data) const {
              if (root == nullptr)  return nullptr;

              if (root->data == data)
                  return root;

              if (data < root->data)
                  return search(root->left, data);
              else
                  return search(root->right, data);
          }


          void inorder(node* root){
              if (root == nullptr) return;

              inorder(root->left);
              cout << root->data << endl;
              inorder(root->right);
          }
      public:
          node* insert(const T& data){
              return insert(head, data);
          }

          node* search(const T& data){
              return search(head, data);
          }

          void inorder(){
              inorder(head);
          }

  };

  int main(){
      BST<int> bst;
      bst.insert(1);
      bst.insert(2);
      bst.insert(3);
      bst.insert(4);
      bst.insert(5);

      bst.inorder();
      return 0;
  }
  ```

## Time and space complexity:
  The time and space complexity of insertion, deletion, and search operations in a Binary Search Tree (BST) depend on the height of the tree, which can vary depending on the order of insertions. 
  Here's a breakdown of the complexities for each case:

  **Time Complexity:**

  | Operation | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Search | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) |
  | Insertion | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) |
  | Deletion | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) |

  **Explanation:**

  * **Best Case (O(log n)):** This occurs when the BST is perfectly balanced, meaning the height of the tree is minimal for the number of nodes (e.g., a complete binary tree).
      In this case, all search, insertion, and deletion operations involve traversing a path down to the desired node in logarithmic time with respect to the number of nodes (n).
  * **Average Case (O(log n)):** Assuming random insertion of elements, the BST tends to be somewhat balanced on average.
      Search, insertion, and deletion operations typically involve traversing a path with a height proportional to the average height of a balanced BST, which is also logarithmic in the number of nodes (O(log n)).
  * **Worst Case (O(n)):** This happens when the BST becomes unbalanced, resembling a linked list.
      In the worst case, all nodes may be strung together in a single path, resulting in a height of n.
      Search, insertion, and deletion operations in this scenario devolve to linear time complexity (O(n)) as they essentially traverse the entire list.

  **Space Complexity:**

  | Operation | Space Complexity |
  |---|---|
  | Search | O(log n) |
  | Insertion | O(log n) |
  | Deletion | O(log n) |

  **Explanation:**

  The space complexity for all operations in a BST is generally considered O(log n) in the best and average cases.
  This is because the recursive calls during search, insertion, and deletion involve a constant amount of extra space on the call stack for storing temporary variables and function pointers.
  However, in the worst-case scenario with an unbalanced tree, the call stack depth can grow linearly with the height (n), leading to a space complexity of O(n) in rare cases.

  **Additional Notes:**

  - Balanced BSTs like AVL trees and Red-Black trees guarantee O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion in all cases due to self-balancing mechanisms.
  - The actual space complexity might be slightly higher than O(log n) due to additional factors like node overhead (storing data and pointers).

  In summary, for a well-balanced BST, you can expect logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for search, insertion, and deletion operations, making it a very efficient data structure for sorted data.
  However, the importance of maintaining balance or using self-balancing BST variants is crucial to avoid potential performance degradation in the worst case.

# Discuss the use of graph algorithms in routing trades to different exchanges.
## Graph Algorithms for Optimal Trade Routing

Cryptocurrency traders, and increasingly stock traders, are looking for the best execution for their trades.
This means finding the exchange with the most favorable price and executing the trade efficiently.
Here's where graph algorithms come in.

### Modeling the Trading Network as a Graph:
* **Exchanges:** We can represent each exchange as a node in the graph.
* **Trading Pairs:** Edges connect the nodes, representing the tradable pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT) between exchanges.
* **Costs:**  We assign weights to the edges. These weights can represent various factors affecting trade execution:
    * Trading fees on each exchange.
    * Liquidity (spread) between the quoted ask and bid prices.
    * Potential delays or execution risks associated with specific exchanges.
#### Visualizing Graph Design for Trading Firms (Equity)

Here's a visualization of how trading firms and investment banks might use a graph design for modeling an equity trading network:

**Nodes:**
* **Brokers:** A (Fidelity), B (Charles Schwab), C (Interactive Brokers) - Represent traditional retail and institutional brokerages.
* **Market Makers:** D (Citadel Securities), E (Virtu Financial) - Entities that provide continuous bid-ask quotes for specific equities.
* **Alternative Trading Systems (ATS):** F (Liquidnet), G (Crossing Network) - Electronic platforms for block trades (large order executions) bypassing public exchanges.
* **Dark Pools:** H (MS Dark Pool), I (UBS MTF) - Private trading venues where orders are hidden from public view.
* **Exchanges:** J (NYSE), K (Nasdaq) - Traditional stock exchanges where equities are publicly traded.

**Edges:**
* **Broker-Client:** Lines connecting Brokers (A, B, C) to client entities (not shown) represent order flow from clients to their brokers.
* **Broker-ATS/Dark Pool:** Lines from Brokers (A, B, C) to ATS/Dark Pool nodes (F, G, H, I) represent potential routes for order execution if the broker seeks anonymity or block trading efficiency.
* **Broker-Market Maker:** Lines from Brokers (A, B, C) to Market Maker nodes (D, E) represent interactions where brokers may seek better pricing or liquidity from market makers.
* **Market Maker-Exchange:** Lines from Market Makers (D, E) to Exchanges (J, K) represent market makers providing liquidity on public exchanges.
* **ATS/Dark Pool-Exchange:** Potential lines connecting ATS/Dark Pool nodes (F, G, H, I) to Exchanges (J, K) represent order routing to exchanges if no suitable counterparty is found within the private venue.

**Edge Weights:**
* **Commissions:** Fees charged by brokers for order execution.
* **Spreads:** Difference between best ask and bid prices across different venues.
* **Liquidity:** Availability of tradable shares at a specific price point within each venue.
* **Market Impact:** Potential price movement caused by a large order.
* **Access Fees:** Fees charged by ATS/Dark Pools for order routing or participation.

**Example Scenario:**
A trading firm receives a large client order to buy shares of Company X (XYZ).
The graph helps them analyze different execution routes considering various factors:

* **Cost:** They can compare commission fees, spreads, and access fees across different venues.
* **Liquidity:**  The graph can indicate where they can find the best order book depth for XYZ shares to minimize market impact.
* **Anonymity:**  If discretion is desired, the firm might choose to route the order through a Dark Pool (H or I) before potentially hitting the exchange (J or K) if no counterparty is found.


##### Sample Graph for Trading Firm Order Routing (Equity)

**Nodes:**
* A - Trading Firm (Your Client)
* B - Broker (Charles Schwab)
* C - ATS (Liquidnet)
* D - Dark Pool (UBS MTF)
* E - Market Maker (Citadel Securities)
* F - Exchange (NYSE)

**Edges:**
* A ---- B (Client Order) - Represents the large client order sent to the trading firm.
* B ---- C (Potential Route) - Broker can route the order to an ATS for potential block trade execution.
* B ---- D (Potential Route) - Broker can route the order to a Dark Pool for anonymous execution.
* B ---- E (Price Improvement) - Broker can interact with a market maker for potentially better pricing.
* E ---- F (Market Liquidity) - Market maker can provide liquidity on the exchange.
* B ---- F (Direct Route) - Broker can also directly route the order to the exchange.

**Data on Edges (Hypothetical):**
* B ---- C (Cost: 0.01% access fee, Liquidity: Moderate)
* B ---- D (Cost: 0.02% access fee, Liquidity: Low)
* B ---- E (Cost: Potential rebate for order flow, Liquidity: High)
* E ---- F (Spread: Narrow)
* B ---- F (Cost: Standard commission, Liquidity: Highest)

**Scenario:**
The trading firm receives a large order to buy XYZ shares from a client (Node A). They can analyze various routes using the graph:
* **ATS (C):** Offers anonymity and potential cost savings (0.01% access fee) with moderate liquidity. However, there's no guarantee of finding a counterparty for the entire order.
* **Dark Pool (D):** Provides complete anonymity with a slightly higher access fee (0.02%) but lower liquidity compared to the ATS.
* **Market Maker (E):** May offer better pricing (rebate for order flow) with high liquidity but might reveal some order information.
* **Exchange (F):** Offers highest liquidity but with standard commission fees and potentially wider spreads.

**Decision Making:**
The trading firm will consider factors like client preferences, order size, and market conditions to choose the optimal route.
* **For anonymity:** They might choose the Dark Pool (D) if liquidity allows for full order execution.
* **For best price:** They could use the Market Maker (E) for potential rebates and high liquidity.
* **For fastest execution:** Routing directly to the Exchange (F) might be suitable if immediate execution is a priority.

**Additional Notes:**
* This is a simplified example. Real-world graphs would have more nodes and edges representing various venues and routing options.
* The data on edges (costs, liquidity) is hypothetical and would vary depending on the specific market and order details.

**Important Note:**
This is a simplified illustration.
Real-world equity trading networks are even more intricate, potentially including additional node types (e.g., high-frequency trading firms) and complex routing algorithms that consider a wider range of factors and real-time market data.

### Graph Algorithms for Optimal Routing:
Graph algorithms are widely used in the financial industry to optimize trading strategies and minimize transaction costs.
One such application is routing trades to different exchanges.
Graph algorithms can be used to model the relationships between different exchanges and the costs associated with trading on each exchange.
This information can then be used to determine the optimal route for a trade, taking into account factors such as liquidity, transaction fees, and execution speed.
* **Shortest Path Algorithms:** These algorithms find the path with the minimum total weight between two nodes (exchanges) for a specific trading pair.
  This path represents the most cost-effective way to route the trade.
  Common examples include Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search.
* **Arbitrage Detection:** We can identify arbitrage opportunities by searching for negative weight cycles in the graph.
  A negative cycle implies you can buy an asset on one exchange, sell it on another, and end up with more than you started with, profiting from price discrepancies.
  This is a complex area with additional considerations, but graph algorithms play a crucial role in initial detection.
* **Bellman-Ford algorithm** is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
* **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** can be used to find the most cost-effective route for a trade, taking into account the costs associated with trading on each exchange.

### Benefits of using Graph Algorithms:
* **Faster Execution:** By finding the most efficient route, traders can execute trades quicker, potentially capturing fleeting price advantages.
* **Reduced Costs:** Minimizing trading fees, spreads, and execution risks leads to better overall trade profitability.
* **Identify Arbitrage Opportunities:** Traders can exploit price discrepancies across exchanges for profit.


### Challenges and Considerations:

* **Real-time Data:**  Cryptocurrency markets are fast-moving.  Algorithms need real-time data on exchange rates, fees, and liquidity to ensure optimal routing.
* **Dynamic Network:**  Exchanges can add or remove trading pairs, and fees can fluctuate. The graph needs to be constantly updated to reflect these changes.
* **Order Book Depth:**  Just finding the best quoted price might not be enough.  Sufficient order book depth (tradable volume at each price level) is crucial for successful execution.


Overall, graph algorithms offer a powerful tool for route optimization in cryptocurrency and potentially traditional security trading.
By efficiently navigating the exchange network, traders can achieve better execution and potentially uncover profitable opportunities.
