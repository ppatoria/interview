Analyst -> HD : Gather daily stock prices
Analyst -> FS : Gather financial statements
note right of FS : Financial statements provide insight into a company's\n financial health and future earnings potential.
Analyst -> RFR : Gather risk-free rate
note right of RFR : The risk-free rate (r) is used in stock pricing models \nto discount future cash flows to present value.
Analyst -> MR : Gather market return data
Analyst -> B : Calculate beta of the stock
note right of B : Beta (β) is a measure of a stock's volatility \nin relation to the overall market.
Analyst -> D : Gather dividend data
note right of D : Dividends are part of the company's profits paid to \nshareholders and are used in the DDM.
Analyst -> EPM : Select DDM, DCF, or CAPM
note right of EPM : These models use dividends, cash flows, and beta to\n calculate the intrinsic value of a stock.
note right of EPM : DDM calculates a stock's price by \ndiscounting predicted dividends to present value.\n For example, if a stock pays annual dividends\n of $2, expected to grow at 3% per year, and the required\n rate of return is 10%, the stock's\n price is calculated as\n \( P = \frac{D}{r - g} = \frac{2}{0.10 - 0.03} = \frac{2}{0.07} = \$28.57 \).

note right of EPM : DCF model values a stock by discounting\n the expected future cash flows to present value.\n For instance,\n if a company is expected to\n generate $100 in cash flow next year, and we use a discount rate of 10%,\n the present value of this cash flow is\n \( PV = \frac{CF}{(1 + r)^n} = \frac{100}{(1 + 0.10)^1} = \$90.91 \).

note right of EPM : CAPM calculates the expected return of\n a stock based on its risk relative to the market.\n If the risk-free rate is 2%, the market return\n is 8%, and the stock's beta is 1.5,\n the expected return using CAPM is\n \( E(R) = r_f + \beta \times (E(R_m) - r_f) = 0.02 + 1.5 \times (0.08 - 0.02) = 0.11 \) or 11%.

EPM -> Analyst : Provide parameters (D, g, r, β)
Analyst -> HD : Estimate growth rate (g)
Analyst -> FS : Estimate future cash flows
Analyst -> EPM : Calibrate model
EPM -> Analyst : Match market data
Analyst -> EPM : Adjust parameters
Analyst -> EPM : Assume market efficiency
EPM -> ST : Validate model fit
ST -> Analyst : Assess goodness of fit
Analyst -> RTP : Use calibrated model
RTP -> Analyst : Calculate fair stock prices
Analyst -> MA : Acknowledge assumptions
MA -> Analyst : Understand deviations
Analyst -> EPM : Ensure alignment with market data
EPM -> Analyst : Provide reliable valuations
Analyst -> EPM : Calculate risk premium using CAPM
EPM -> Analyst : Provide expected return
