# Explanation:

To find the middle element of a singly linked list in **one pass**, we can use the **fast and slow pointer technique**. Here’s how it works:

1. **Pointers**:
   - Use two pointers: a **slow pointer** and a **fast pointer**.
   - Both pointers start at the head of the linked list.

2. **Pointer Movement**:
   - Move the **slow pointer** one step at a time.
   - Move the **fast pointer** two steps at a time.

3. **Why It Works**:
   - The **fast pointer** moves twice as fast as the **slow pointer**, so when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be halfway through.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list has an odd number of nodes, the slow pointer will point to the exact middle.
   - If the list has an even number of nodes, the slow pointer will point to the **second middle element** when the fast pointer reaches the end.

5. **Single Pass**:
   - This approach ensures we traverse the list only once, making it efficient.

6. **Empty or One Node**:
   - If the list is empty, there’s no middle element.
   - If the list has only one node, that node is the middle element. 

This method is simple, efficient, and avoids the need for calculating the size of the linked list beforehand.


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <forward_list>

void findMiddle(std::forward_list<int>& list) {
    if (list.empty()) {
        std::cout << "List is empty\n";
        return;
    }

    auto slow = list.begin();
    auto fast = list.begin();

    // Move the fast pointer two steps and the slow pointer one step
    // until the fast pointer reaches the end
    while (fast != list.end() && std::next(fast) != list.end()) {
        slow = std::next(slow); // Move slow pointer one step
        fast = std::next(fast, 2); // Move fast pointer two steps
    }

    // At this point, slow points to the middle element
    std::cout << "Middle element: " << *slow << "\n";
}

int main() {
    std::forward_list<int> list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    findMiddle(list);

    return 0;
}
```


# Time Complexity:
- We traverse the list using two pointers: the `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, and the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.
- The loop continues until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list. In the worst case, we traverse the list once, which takes **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of elements in the list.

# Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are only using a constant amount of extra space. We are only storing a few pointers (`slow`, `fast`), and no additional data structures or memory is allocated that depends on the size of the input list.

Thus, the solution is efficient in terms of both time and space.
