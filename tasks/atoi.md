### (1) **Explanation of the Most Efficient Solution**

To implement a string-to-integer conversion (like `atoi`), the approach can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Skip Leading Whitespaces**: The first thing to do is ignore any leading spaces, as they don’t contribute to the integer value.
2. **Handle Optional Sign**: Check if the number has an optional sign (`+` or `-`). If a sign is present, record it, but don’t include it in the conversion process yet.
3. **Convert Characters to Digits**: Start processing each character one by one. If the character is a digit (`0-9`), convert it to its integer value by subtracting the ASCII value of `'0'` from the character.
4. **Accumulate the Result**: As you process each digit, shift the previously accumulated result by a factor of 10 (to handle place values). For example, for "123", you would calculate `0 * 10 + 1 = 1`, then `1 * 10 + 2 = 12`, then `12 * 10 + 3 = 123`.
5. **Handle Overflow**: Since the result might overflow (for instance, a number that’s too large to fit in an `int`), check whether the result exceeds the limits of `INT_MAX` or `INT_MIN` during the calculation. If it does, return the appropriate limit value (`INT_MAX` or `INT_MIN`).
6. **Return the Result**: Once all characters have been processed and accumulated, return the result with the appropriate sign.

### (2) **Solution Code using STL**

Here's the implementation of `atoi` using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
#include <string>

int myAtoi(const std::string& str) {
    int i = 0, result = 0, sign = 1;

    // Skip leading whitespaces
    while (i < str.size() && str[i] == ' ') {
        i++;
    }

    // Handle optional sign
    if (i < str.size() && (str[i] == '+' || str[i] == '-')) {
        sign = (str[i] == '-') ? -1 : 1;
        i++;
    }

    // Convert characters to integer
    while (i < str.size() && str[i] >= '0' && str[i] <= '9') {
        int digit = str[i] - '0';

        // Check for overflow or underflow before multiplying by 10
        if (result > (INT_MAX - digit) / 10) {
            return (sign == 1) ? INT_MAX : INT_MIN;
        }

        result = result * 10 + digit;
        i++;
    }

    return result * sign;
}

int main() {
    std::string str = "  -42";  // Example input

    std::cout << "Converted Integer: " << myAtoi(str) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### (3) **Time and Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. We need to iterate through each character in the string exactly once to process it.
  
- **Space Complexity: O(1)**. We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables like `i`, `result`, and `sign`.

This approach efficiently handles the string-to-integer conversion while ensuring correctness for edge cases such as whitespace, invalid characters, overflow, and sign handling.
