### **Elaborative Take-Home Task Examples**

**Task 1: Implement a Low-Latency Order Matching Engine**

*Problem Statement*:

Design and implement a simplified order matching engine for a fictional exchange. The engine should handle the following functionalities:

- **Order Types**:
  - Limit Orders: Execute at a specified price or better.
  - Market Orders: Execute immediately at the best available price.

- **Operations**:
  - Add new orders to the order book.
  - Match orders based on price-time priority.
  - Cancel existing orders.

*Requirements*:

- Use C++14 or later standards.
- Ensure thread-safe operations to handle concurrent order submissions and cancellations.
- Optimize for low latency and high throughput.
- Provide a simple command-line interface to interact with the engine.

*Deliverables*:

- Source code with appropriate documentation.
- Instructions to build and run the application.
- A brief report explaining design decisions, data structures used, and potential improvements.

**Task 2: Develop a High-Performance Market Data Feed Handler**

*Problem Statement*:

Create a C++ application that processes incoming market data feeds and maintains an updated order book. The application should:

- **Input**:
  - Simulated market data messages containing order additions, modifications, and cancellations.

- **Output**:
  - An in-memory representation of the current state of the order book.
  - Ability to query the best bid and ask prices at any given time.

*Requirements*:

- Implement using C++14 or later.
- Ensure minimal latency in processing incoming messages.
- Handle high-frequency data bursts gracefully.
- Design the system to be extensible for handling multiple instruments.

*Deliverables*:

- Source code with clear documentation.
- Test cases demonstrating the correctness and performance of the feed handler.
- A short write-up detailing the architecture, challenges faced, and optimization techniques employed.

**Task 3: Optimize an Existing Trading Strategy Simulation**

*Problem Statement*:

You are provided with a basic simulation of a trading strategy written in C++. The current implementation has performance bottlenecks affecting its speed and responsiveness. Your task is to:

- **Profile the Application**:
  - Identify functions or sections of code that are performance-critical.

- **Optimize**:
  - Apply appropriate optimization techniques to reduce latency and improve throughput.

- **Validate**:
  - Ensure that optimizations do not alter the functional correctness of the simulation.

*Requirements*:

- Document the profiling process and findings.
- Implement optimizations using C++14 or later features where applicable.
