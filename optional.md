`std::optional` is a feature from the C++17 standard that provides a way to represent 'optional' valuesâ€”values that may or may not be present.
Here's a detailed look at `std::optional`:

### Design and Purpose:
- **Design**  : `std::optional<T>` is a template class that encapsulates an optional value of type `T`.
                It can be thought of as a container that either holds a single value of `T` or nothing.
- **Purpose** : Its primary use is to indicate the presence or absence of a value,
                avoiding the need for sentinel values or pointers to signal a value's absence.

### Implementation Under the Hood:
- **Storage**                  : Internally, `std::optional` typically uses a union to store the value and a boolean flag to indicate whether the value is present.
- **Construction/Destruction** : It does not default-construct the underlying object when in a 'null-state'.
                                 The object is constructed using placement new when a value is assigned,
                                 and destroyed when the `std::optional` is reset or destroyed.

### Efficiency:
- **Performance**            : Using `std::optional` introduces some overhead due to the additional boolean flag and the need to check this flag when accessing the value.
- **Memory**                 : It does not use dynamic memory allocation;
                               the value is stored within the `std::optional` object itself, which can be more efficient than heap allocation.
- **supports move semantics**: If the contained type `T` has a move constructor, `std::optional<T>` can store a `T` object by moving it.
                               This is more efficient than copying, especially for types that are expensive to copy but cheap to move,
                               like containers or unique pointers.

Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <optional>
#include <utility> // For std::move

class MoveableType {
public:
    MoveableType() = default;
    MoveableType(const MoveableType&) = delete; // Deleted copy constructor
    MoveableType& operator=(const MoveableType&) = delete; // Deleted copy assignment operator
    MoveableType(MoveableType&&) noexcept = default; // Move constructor
    MoveableType& operator=(MoveableType&&) noexcept = default; // Move assignment operator
};

int main() {
    MoveableType obj;
    std::optional<MoveableType> opt(std::move(obj)); // Moves obj into the optional
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `MoveableType` is a move-only type, and we can construct an `std::optional<MoveableType>` by moving an instance of `MoveableType` into it.
The move constructor of `MoveableType` is called, and no copy is made.
This demonstrates that `std::optional` can indeed utilize move semantics when the contained type supports it.

### When to Use:
- **Uncertain Values**   : When a function might not return a value or when a value is not always required.
- **Safer Alternatives** : As a safer, more expressive alternative to using pointers (like `nullptr` to indicate absence) or special sentinel values.

### When Not to Use (Alternatives):
- **Known Non-Empty Values**    : If a value will always be present, use the type directly without `std::optional`.
- **Error Handling**            : For functions that might fail, consider using error codes, exceptions, or `std::expected` (upcoming in C++23) instead of `std::optional`.
- **Performance-Critical Code** : If the performance overhead of `std::optional` is a concern,
                                  especially in tight loops or real-time systems, it might be better to use other approaches.

In summary, `std::optional` is a versatile tool that can make code safer and more readable by explicitly handling the presence or absence of values.
However, it's important to consider the alternatives and use `std::optional` judiciously to avoid unnecessary overhead where a simpler solution would suffice.
